Problem 14
The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive
 integers:
n → n/2 (n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following
 sequence:
13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1)
 contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem),
 it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

Problem 15

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

Problem 16
215 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.
What is the sum of the digits of the number 21000?

Problem 17
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four,
 five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written
 out in words, how many letters would be used?
NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred
 and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen)
 contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in
 compliance with British usage.

Problem 18
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent

NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem
 by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with
 a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute
 force, and requires a clever method! ;o)

Problem 19
You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some
 research for yourself.
1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
Thirty days has September,
April, June and November.
All the rest have thirty-one,
Saving February alone,
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
And on leap years, twenty-nine.
A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a
 century unless it is divisible by 400.
How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth
 century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

Problem 20
n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1
For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,and the sum
 of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.
Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

Problem 21
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less
 than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ≠ b, then a and b are an amicable
 pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,
 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1,
 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

Problem 22
Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text
 file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it
 into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for
 each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list
 to obtain a name score.
For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
 which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the
 list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.
What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

Problem 23
A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors
 is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper
 divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28
 is a perfect number.
A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less
 than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the
 smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is
 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater
 than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However,
 this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though
 it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the
 sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.
Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as
 the sum of two abundant numbers.

Problem 24
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124
 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of
 the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it
 lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
012   021   102   120   201   210
What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2,
 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

Problem 25
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
Hence the first 12 terms will be:
F1 = 1
F2 = 1
F3 = 2
F4 = 3
F5 = 5
F6 = 8
F7 = 13
F8 = 21
F9 = 34
F10 = 55
F11 = 89
F12 = 144
The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.
What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain
 1000 digits?

Problem 26
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation
 of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

1/2= 0.5
1/3= 0.(3)
1/4= 0.25
1/5= 0.2
1/6= 0.1(6)
1/7= 0.(142857)
1/8= 0.125
1/9= 0.(1)
1/10= 0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It
 can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.
Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring
 cycle in its decimal fraction part.

Problem 27
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
$n^2 + n + 41$
It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive
 integer values $0 \le n \le 39$. However, when $n = 40, 40^2 + 40 +
 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $n = 41,
 41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by 41.
The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produces
 80 primes for the consecutive values $0 \le n \le 79$. The product of
 the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.
Considering quadratics of the form:

$n^2 + an + b$, where $|a| < 1000$ and $|b| \le 1000$where $|n|$ is the
 modulus/absolute value of $n$e.g. $|11| = 11$ and $|-4| = 4$

Find the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic
 expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive
 values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.

Problem 28
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise
 direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 1217 16 15 14 13
It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

 formed in the same way?

Problem 29
Consider all integer combinations of ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b
 ≤ 5:
22=4, 23=8, 24=16, 25=32
32=9, 33=27, 34=81, 35=243
42=16, 43=64, 44=256, 45=1024
52=25, 53=125, 54=625, 55=3125
If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed,
 we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:
4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125
How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by ab for 2 ≤
 a ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100?

Problem 30
Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the
 sum of fourth powers of their digits:
1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44
8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84
9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44
As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.
The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth
 powers of their digits.

Problem 31
In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence
 (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:
1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).
It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

Problem 32
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of
 all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number,
 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 × 186 = 7254, containing
 multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
 identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to
 only include it once in your sum.

Problem 33
The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced
 mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that
 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction,
 less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator
 and denominator.
If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common
 terms, find the value of the denominator.

 of their digits.
Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

Problem 35
The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of
 the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.
There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31,
 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.
How many circular primes are there below one million?

 leading zeros.)

Problem 37
The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is
 possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain
 prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from
 right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.
Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from

NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

Problem 38
Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:
192 × 1 = 192
192 × 2 = 384
192 × 3 = 576
By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We
 will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)
The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3,
 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated
 product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

Problem 42
The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn =
 ½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
 alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
 example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word
 value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

 triangle words?

Problem 43
The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made
 up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather
 interesting sub-string divisibility property.
Let d1 be the 1st digit, d2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way,
 we note the following:

 first ten pentagonal numbers are:

It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their
 difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

9 = 7 + 2×12
15 = 7 + 2×22
21 = 3 + 2×32
25 = 7 + 2×32

Problem 49
The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms
 increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms
 are prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of
 one another.
There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit
 primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit
 increasing sequence.

By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that six
 of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.
By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this
 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten
 generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443,

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345
In combinatorics, we use the notation, $\displaystyle \binom 5 3 = 10$.
In general, $\displaystyle \binom n r = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $r

 and $0! = 1$.

It is not until $n = 23$, that a value exceeds one-million: $\displaystyle

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of $\displaystyle \binom n r$
 for $1 \le n \le 100$, are greater than one-million?

 from lowest to highest, in the following way:
High Card: Highest value card.
One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
Flush: All cards of the same suit.
Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.
The cards are valued in the order:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack,
 Queen, King, Ace.
If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the
 highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives
 (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players
 have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared
 (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest
 cards are compared, and so on.
Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:

The file, poker.txt, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two
 players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by
 a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last
 five are Player 2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid
 (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no
 specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner.
How many hands does Player 1 win?

Problem 55
If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
349 + 943 = 1292,
1292 + 2921 = 4213
4213 + 3124 = 7337
That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers,
 like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a
 palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel
 number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the
 purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until
 proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below
 ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty
 iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists,
 has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first
 number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing
 a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).
Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel
 numbers; the first example is 4994.
How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?
NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the
 theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.

Problem 56
A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros;
 100100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred
 zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is
 only 1.
Considering natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b < 100, what is
 the maximum digital sum?

Problem 57
It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as
 an infinite continued fraction.
$\sqrt 2 =1+ \frac 1 {2+ \frac 1 {2 +\frac 1 {2+ \dots}}}$
By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
$1 + \frac 1 2 = \frac  32 = 1.5$
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 2} = \frac 7 5 = 1.4$
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}} = \frac {17}{12} = 1.41666 \dots$
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}}} = \frac {41}{29}
 = 1.41379 \dots$
The next three expansions are $\frac {99}{70}$, $\frac {239}{169}$,
 and $\frac {577}{408}$, but the eighth expansion, $\frac {1393}{985}$,
 is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds
 the number of digits in the denominator.
In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a
 numerator with more digits than the denominator?

Problem 58
Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way,
 a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30

42 21 22 23 24 25 2643 44 45 46 47 48 49
It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
 diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers
 lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈ 62%.
If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
 spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
 what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of
 primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

Problem 59
Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the
 preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
 Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and
 lowercase k = 107.
A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the
 bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a
 secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same
 encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example,
 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.
For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text
 message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep
 the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations,
 and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.
Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified
 method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than
 the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout
 the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long
 password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.
Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three
 lower case characters. Using p059_cipher.txt (right click and 'Save
 Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the
 knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt
 the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.

Problem 60
The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two
 primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be
 prime. For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The
 sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of
 four primes with this property.
Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes
 concatenate to produce another prime.

Problem 61
Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal
 numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the
 following formulae:
Triangle
 
P3,n=n(n+1)/2
 
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
Square
 
P4,n=n2
 
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
Pentagonal
 
P5,n=n(3n−1)/2
 
1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
Hexagonal

Heptagonal
 
P7,n=n(5n−3)/2

Octagonal
 
P8,n=n(3n−2)
 
1, 8, 21, 40, 65, ...
The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three
 interesting properties.
The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first
 two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).
Each polygonal type: triangle (P3,127=8128), square (P4,91=8281), and
 pentagonal (P5,44=2882), is represented by a different number in the set.
This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property.
Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for
 which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal,
 heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in
 the set.

Problem 62
The cube, 41063625 (3453), can be permuted to produce two other cubes:
 56623104 (3843) and 66430125 (4053). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest
 cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are
 also cube.
Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits
 are cube.

Problem 63
The 5-digit number, 16807=75, is also a fifth power. Similarly, the
 9-digit number, 134217728=89, is a ninth power.
How many n-digit positive integers exist which are also an nth power?

Problem 64
All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and
 can be written in the form:

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{N}=a_0+\frac 1 {a_1+\frac 1 {a_2+
 \frac 1 {a3+ \dots}}}$

For example, let us consider $\sqrt{23}:$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\sqrt{23}-4=4+\frac 1 {\frac 1
 {\sqrt{23}-4}}=4+\frac 1  {1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}7}$

If we continue we would get the following expansion:

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {3+ \frac 1
 {1+\frac 1 {8+ \dots}}}}$

The process can be summarised as follows:

$\quad \quad a_0=4, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac
 {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$
$\quad \quad a_1=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+3)}
 {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$
$\quad \quad a_2=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)}
 {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$
$\quad \quad a_3=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)}
 7=8+\sqrt{23}-4$
$\quad \quad a_4=8, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac
 {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$
$\quad \quad a_5=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7 (\sqrt{23}+3)}
 {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$

$\quad \quad a_6=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)}
 {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$
$\quad \quad a_7=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)}
 {7}=8+\sqrt{23}-4$
It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use
 the notation $\sqrt{23}=[4;(1,3,1,8)]$, to indicate that the block
 (1,3,1,8) repeats indefinitely.
The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational) square
 roots are:

$\quad \quad \sqrt{2}=[1;(2)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{3}=[1;(1,2)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{5}=[2;(4)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{6}=[2;(2,4)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{7}=[2;(1,1,1,4)]$, period=$4$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{8}=[2;(1,4)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{10}=[3;(6)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{11}=[3;(3,6)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{12}=[3;(2,6)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{13}=[3;(1,1,1,1,6)]$, period=$5$

Exactly four continued fractions, for $N \le 13$, have an odd period.
How many continued fractions for $N \le 10\,000$ have an odd period?

Problem 65
The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.
$\sqrt{2} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2
 + ...}}}}$
The infinite continued fraction can be written, $\sqrt{2} = [1; (2)]$,
 $(2)$ indicates that 2 repeats ad infinitum. In a similar way, $\sqrt{23}
 = [4; (1, 3, 1, 8)]$.
It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions
 for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us
 consider the convergents for $\sqrt{2}$.
$\begin{align}
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{3}{2} \\
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{7}{5}\\
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}} = \dfrac{17}{12}\\
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}} =
 \dfrac{41}{29}
\end{align}$
Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for $\sqrt{2}$ are:
$1, \dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{7}{5}, \dfrac{17}{12}, \dfrac{41}{29},
 \dfrac{99}{70}, \dfrac{239}{169}, \dfrac{577}{408}, \dfrac{1393}{985},
 \dfrac{3363}{2378}, ...$
What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,$e =
 [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, ... , 1, 2k, 1, ...]$.
The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:
$2, 3, \dfrac{8}{3}, \dfrac{11}{4}, \dfrac{19}{7}, \dfrac{87}{32},
 \dfrac{106}{39}, \dfrac{193}{71}, \dfrac{1264}{465}, \dfrac{1457}{536},
 ...$
The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10th convergent is $1 + 4 +
 5 + 7 = 17$.
Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100th convergent of the
 continued fraction for $e$.

Problem 66
Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
x2 – Dy2 = 1
For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 – 13×1802
 = 1.
It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when
 D is square.
By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain
 the following:
32 – 2×22 = 1
22 – 3×12 = 192 – 5×42 = 1
52 – 6×22 = 1
82 – 7×32 = 1
Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D ≤ 7, the largest
 x is obtained when D=5.
Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the
 largest value of x is obtained.

Problem 67
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent
 numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

8 5 9 3
That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
Find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt (right click
 and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle
 with one-hundred rows.
NOTE: This is a much more difficult version of Problem 18. It is not
 possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 299
 altogether! If you could check one trillion (1012) routes every second
 it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an
 efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)

Problem 68
Consider the following "magic" 3-gon ring, filled with the numbers 1 to 6,
 and each line adding to nine.


Working clockwise, and starting from the group of three with the
 numerically lowest external node (4,3,2 in this example), each solution
 can be described uniquely. For example, the above solution can be
 described by the set: 4,3,2; 6,2,1; 5,1,3.
It is possible to complete the ring with four different totals: 9, 10,
 11, and 12. There are eight solutions in total.

TotalSolution Set
94,2,3; 5,3,1; 6,1,2
94,3,2; 6,2,1; 5,1,3
102,3,5; 4,5,1; 6,1,3
102,5,3; 6,3,1; 4,1,5
111,4,6; 3,6,2; 5,2,4
111,6,4; 5,4,2; 3,2,6
121,5,6; 2,6,4; 3,4,5
121,6,5; 3,5,4; 2,4,6

By concatenating each group it is possible to form 9-digit strings;
 the maximum string for a 3-gon ring is 432621513.
Using the numbers 1 to 10, and depending on arrangements, it is possible
 to form 16- and 17-digit strings. What is the maximum 16-digit string
 for a "magic" 5-gon ring?



Problem 69
Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function],
 is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are
 relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all
 less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.

It can be seen that n=6 produces a maximum n/φ(n) for n ≤ 10.
Find the value of n ≤ 1,000,000 for which n/φ(n) is a maximum.

Problem 70
Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function],
 is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal
 to n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7,
 and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.The
 number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number,
 so φ(1)=1.
Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a
 permutation of 79180.
Find the value of n, 1 < n < 107, for which φ(n) is a permutation of
 n and the ratio n/φ(n) produces a minimum.

Problem 71
Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d
 and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending
 order of size, we get:
1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8,
 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.
By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000 in
 ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately
 to the left of 3/7.

Problem 72
Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d
 and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending
 order of size, we get:
1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8,
 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set.
How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper
 fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000?

Problem 73
Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d
 and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending
 order of size, we get:
1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8,
 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.
How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced
 proper fractions for d ≤ 12,000?

Problem 74
The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the
 factorial of its digits is equal to 145:
1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of
 numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three
 such loops that exist:
169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169
871 → 45361 → 871
872 → 45362 → 872
It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually
 get stuck in a loop. For example,
69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454)
78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871)
540 → 145 (→ 145)
Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the
 longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million
 is sixty terms.
How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain
 exactly sixty non-repeating terms?

Problem 75
It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be
 bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way,
 but there are many more examples.
12 cm: (3,4,5)24 cm: (6,8,10)30 cm: (5,12,13)36 cm: (9,12,15)40 cm:
 (8,15,17)48 cm: (12,16,20)
In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an
 integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than
 one solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to
 form exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.
120 cm: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)
Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of L ≤
 1,500,000 can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?

Problem 76

What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in
 over five thousand different ways?

Problem 78
Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can

Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.

Problem 79
A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for
 three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode
 was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the
 expected reply would be: 317.
The text file, keylog.txt, contains fifty successful login attempts.
Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse
 the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of
 unknown length.

Problem 80
It is well known that if the square root of a natural number is not an
 integer, then it is irrational. The decimal expansion of such square
 roots is infinite without any repeating pattern at all.
The square root of two is 1.41421356237309504880..., and the digital
 sum of the first one hundred decimal digits is 475.
For the first one hundred natural numbers, find the total of the digital

Problem 84
In the game, Monopoly, the standard board is set up in the following way:


A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided
 dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise
 direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square
 with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC
 (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.
In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders
 the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive
 doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they
 proceed directly to jail.
At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a
 player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective
 pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom
 of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose
 of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement;
 any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the
 player will remain on the CC/CH square.
Community Chest (2/16 cards):
Advance to GO
Go to JAIL

Chance (10/16 cards):
Advance to GO
Go to JAIL
Go to C1
Go to E3
Go to H2
Go to R1
Go to next R (railway company)
Go to next R
Go to next U (utility company)
Go back 3 squares.

The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular
 square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a
 roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of
 G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares
 will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another
 square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each
 roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between
 "Just Visiting" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the
 rule about requiring a double to "get out of jail", assuming that they
 pay to get out on their next turn.
By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to
 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that
 correspond with sets of squares.
Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in
 order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO
 (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed
 with the six-digit modal string: 102400.
If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find
 the six-digit modal string.

Problem 85
By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring
 3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles:


Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains exactly two
 million rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.

Problem 86
A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by 3,
 and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces
 of the room the shortest "straight line" distance from S to F is 10
 and the path is shown on the diagram.


However, there are up to three "shortest" path candidates for any given
 cuboid and the shortest route doesn't always have integer length.
It can be shown that there are exactly 2060 distinct cuboids, ignoring
 rotations, with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of M by M by M,
 for which the shortest route has integer length when M = 100. This is
 the least value of M for which the number of solutions first exceeds
 two thousand; the number of solutions when M = 99 is 1975.
Find the least value of M such that the number of solutions first exceeds
 one million.

Problem 87
The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube,
 and prime fourth power is 28. In fact, there are exactly four numbers
 below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:
28 = 22 + 23 + 24
33 = 32 + 23 + 24
49 = 52 + 23 + 24
47 = 22 + 33 + 24
How many numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a
 prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power?

Problem 88
A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a
 given set of at least two natural numbers, {a1, a2, ... , ak} is called
 a product-sum number: N = a1 + a2 + ... + ak = a1 × a2 × ... × ak.
For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.
For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this
 property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers
 for sets of size, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.
k=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2k=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3k=4: 8 = 1 × 1
 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4k=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2  = 1 + 1 + 2 +
 2 + 2k=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6
Hence for 2≤k≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is
 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.
In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12
 is {4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.
What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12000?

Problem 6
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
$$1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385$$
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
$$(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025$$
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
 natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 - 385 = 2640$.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
 hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Problem 14
The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive
 integers:
n → n/2 (n is even)n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following
 sequence:
13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1)
 contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem),
 it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

Problem 15
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to
 move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom
 right corner.


How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

Problem 16
215 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.
What is the sum of the digits of the number 21000?

Problem 17
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four,
 five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written
 out in words, how many letters would be used?
NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred
 and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen)
 contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in
 compliance with British usage.

Problem 18
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent
 numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.
37 4
2 4 6
8 5 9 3
That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:
75
95 64
17 47 82
18 35 87 10
20 04 82 47 65
19 01 23 75 03 34

04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23
NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem
 by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with
 a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute
 force, and requires a clever method! ;o)

Problem 19
You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some
 research for yourself.
1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
Thirty days has September,
April, June and November.
All the rest have thirty-one,
Saving February alone,
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
And on leap years, twenty-nine.
A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a
 century unless it is divisible by 400.
How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth
 century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

Problem 20
n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1
For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,and the sum
 of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.
Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

Problem 21
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less
 than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ≠ b, then a and b are an amicable
 pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,
 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1,
 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

Problem 22
Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text
 file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it
 into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for
 each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list
 to obtain a name score.
For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
 which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the
 list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.
What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

Problem 23
A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors
 is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper
 divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28
 is a perfect number.
A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less
 than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the
 smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is
 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater
 than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However,
 this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though
 it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the
 sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.
Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as
 the sum of two abundant numbers.

Problem 24
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124
 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of
 the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it
 lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
012   021   102   120   201   210
What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2,
 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

Problem 25
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
Hence the first 12 terms will be:
F1 = 1
F2 = 1
F3 = 2
F4 = 3
F5 = 5
F6 = 8
F7 = 13
F8 = 21
F9 = 34
F10 = 55
F11 = 89
F12 = 144
The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.
What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain
 1000 digits?

Problem 26
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation
 of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

1/2= 0.5
1/3= 0.(3)
1/4= 0.25
1/5= 0.2
1/6= 0.1(6)
1/7= 0.(142857)
1/8= 0.125
1/9= 0.(1)
1/10= 0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It
 can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.
Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring
 cycle in its decimal fraction part.

Problem 27
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
$n^2 + n + 41$
It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive
 integer values $0 \le n \le 39$. However, when $n = 40, 40^2 + 40 +
 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $n = 41,
 41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by 41.
The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produces
 80 primes for the consecutive values $0 \le n \le 79$. The product of
 the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.
Considering quadratics of the form:

$n^2 + an + b$, where $|a| < 1000$ and $|b| \le 1000$where $|n|$ is the
 modulus/absolute value of $n$e.g. $|11| = 11$ and $|-4| = 4$

Find the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic
 expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive
 values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.

Problem 28
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise
 direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 1217 16 15 14 13
It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral
 formed in the same way?

Problem 29
Consider all integer combinations of ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b
 ≤ 5:
22=4, 23=8, 24=16, 25=32
32=9, 33=27, 34=81, 35=243
42=16, 43=64, 44=256, 45=1024
52=25, 53=125, 54=625, 55=3125
If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed,
 we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:
4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125
How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by ab for 2 ≤
 a ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100?

Problem 30
Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the
 sum of fourth powers of their digits:
1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44
8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84
9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44
As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.
The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth
 powers of their digits.

Problem 31
In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence
 (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:
1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).
It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

Problem 32
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of
 all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number,
 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 × 186 = 7254, containing
 multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
 identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to
 only include it once in your sum.

Problem 33
The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced
 mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that
 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction,
 less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator
 and denominator.
If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common
 terms, find the value of the denominator.

Problem 34
145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial
 of their digits.
Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

Problem 35
The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of
 the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.
There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31,
 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.
How many circular primes are there below one million?

Problem 36
The decimal number, 585 = 10010010012 (binary), is palindromic in
 both bases.
Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic
 in base 10 and base 2.
(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include
 leading zeros.)

Problem 37
The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is
 possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain
 prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from
 right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.
Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from
 left to right and right to left.
NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

Problem 38
Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:
192 × 1 = 192
192 × 2 = 384
192 × 3 = 576
By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We
 will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)
The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3,
 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated
 product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).
What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as
 the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?

Problem 39
If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length
 sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

For which value of p ≤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

Problem 40
An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive
 integers:
0.123456789101112131415161718192021...
It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.
If dn represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value
 of the following expression.
d1 × d10 × d100 × d1000 × d10000 × d100000 × d1000000

Problem 41
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of
 all the digits 1 to n exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit
 pandigital and is also prime.
What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?

Problem 42
The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn =
 ½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
 alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
 example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word
 value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text
 file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are
 triangle words?

Problem 43
The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made
 up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather
 interesting sub-string divisibility property.
Let d1 be the 1st digit, d2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way,
 we note the following:
d2d3d4=406 is divisible by 2
d3d4d5=063 is divisible by 3
d4d5d6=635 is divisible by 5
d5d6d7=357 is divisible by 7
d6d7d8=572 is divisible by 11
d7d8d9=728 is divisible by 13
d8d9d10=289 is divisible by 17
Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.

Problem 44
Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n−1)/2. The
 first ten pentagonal numbers are:
1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...
It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their
 difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.
Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and
 difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk − Pj| is minimised; what is
 the value of D?

Problem 45
Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the
 following formulae:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...

It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

Problem 46
It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number
 can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
9 = 7 + 2×12
15 = 7 + 2×22
21 = 3 + 2×32
25 = 7 + 2×32
27 = 19 + 2×22
33 = 31 + 2×12
It turns out that the conjecture was false.
What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of
 a prime and twice a square?

Problem 47
The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:
14 = 2 × 715 = 3 × 5
The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime
 factors are:
644 = 2² × 7 × 23645 = 3 × 5 × 43646 = 2 × 17 × 19.
Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime
 factors each. What is the first of these numbers?

Problem 48
The series, 11 + 22 + 33 + ... + 1010 = 10405071317.

Problem 49
The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms
 increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms
 are prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of
 one another.
There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit
 primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit
 increasing sequence.
What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in
 this sequence?

Problem 50
The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime
 below one-hundred.
The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to
 a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.
Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most
 consecutive primes?

Problem 51
By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that six
 of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.
By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this
 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten
 generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443,
 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of
 this family, is the smallest prime with this property.
Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not
 necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight
 prime value family.

Problem 52
It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain
 exactly the same digits, but in a different order.
Find the smallest positive integer, x, such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x,
 contain the same digits.

Problem 53
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:
123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345
In combinatorics, we use the notation, $\displaystyle \binom 5 3 = 10$.
In general, $\displaystyle \binom n r = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $r
 \le n$, $n! = n \times (n-1) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$,
 and $0! = 1$.

It is not until $n = 23$, that a value exceeds one-million: $\displaystyle
 \binom {23} {10} = 1144066$.
How many, not necessarily distinct, values of $\displaystyle \binom n r$
 for $1 \le n \le 100$, are greater than one-million?

Problem 54
In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked,
 from lowest to highest, in the following way:
High Card: Highest value card.
One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
Flush: All cards of the same suit.
Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.
The cards are valued in the order:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack,
 Queen, King, Ace.
If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the
 highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives
 (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players
 have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared
 (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest
 cards are compared, and so on.
Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:

Hand Player 1 Player 2 Winner

The file, poker.txt, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two
 players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by
 a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last
 five are Player 2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid
 (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no
 specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner.
How many hands does Player 1 win?

Problem 55
If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
349 + 943 = 1292,
1292 + 2921 = 4213
4213 + 3124 = 7337
That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers,
 like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a
 palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel
 number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the
 purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until
 proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below
 ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty
 iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists,
 has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first
 number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing
 a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).
Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel
 numbers; the first example is 4994.
How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?
NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the
 theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.

Problem 56
A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros;
 100100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred
 zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is
 only 1.
Considering natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b < 100, what is
 the maximum digital sum?

Problem 57
It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as
 an infinite continued fraction.
$\sqrt 2 =1+ \frac 1 {2+ \frac 1 {2 +\frac 1 {2+ \dots}}}$
By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
$1 + \frac 1 2 = \frac  32 = 1.5$
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 2} = \frac 7 5 = 1.4$
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}} = \frac {17}{12} = 1.41666 \dots$
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}}} = \frac {41}{29}
 = 1.41379 \dots$
The next three expansions are $\frac {99}{70}$, $\frac {239}{169}$,
 and $\frac {577}{408}$, but the eighth expansion, $\frac {1393}{985}$,
 is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds
 the number of digits in the denominator.
In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a
 numerator with more digits than the denominator?

Problem 58
Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way,
 a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18  5  4  3 12 29

42 21 22 23 24 25 2643 44 45 46 47 48 49
It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
 diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers
 lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈ 62%.
If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
 spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
 what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of
 primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

Problem 59
Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the
 preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
 Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and
 lowercase k = 107.
A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the
 bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a
 secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same
 encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example,
 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.
For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text
 message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep
 the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations,
 and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.
Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified
 method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than
 the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout
 the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long
 password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.
Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three
 lower case characters. Using p059_cipher.txt (right click and 'Save
 Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the
 knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt
 the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.

Problem 60
The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two
 primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be
 prime. For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The
 sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of
 four primes with this property.
Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes
 concatenate to produce another prime.

Problem 61
Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal
 numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the
 following formulae:
Triangle
 
P3,n=n(n+1)/2
 
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
Square
 
P4,n=n2
 
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
Pentagonal
 
P5,n=n(3n−1)/2

P8,n=n(3n−2)
 
1, 8, 21, 40, 65, ...
The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three
 interesting properties.
The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first
 two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).
Each polygonal type: triangle (P3,127=8128), square (P4,91=8281), and
 pentagonal (P5,44=2882), is represented by a different number in the set.
This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property.
Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for
 which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal,
 heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in
 the set.

Problem 62
The cube, 41063625 (3453), can be permuted to produce two other cubes:
 56623104 (3843) and 66430125 (4053). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest
 cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are
 also cube.
Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits
 are cube.

Problem 63
The 5-digit number, 16807=75, is also a fifth power. Similarly, the
 9-digit number, 134217728=89, is a ninth power.
How many n-digit positive integers exist which are also an nth power?

Problem 64
All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and
 can be written in the form:

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{N}=a_0+\frac 1 {a_1+\frac 1 {a_2+
 \frac 1 {a3+ \dots}}}$

For example, let us consider $\sqrt{23}:$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\sqrt{23}-4=4+\frac 1 {\frac 1
 {\sqrt{23}-4}}=4+\frac 1  {1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}7}$

If we continue we would get the following expansion:

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {3+ \frac 1
 {1+\frac 1 {8+ \dots}}}}$

The process can be summarised as follows:

$\quad \quad a_0=4, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac
 {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$
$\quad \quad a_1=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+3)}
 {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$
$\quad \quad a_2=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)}
 {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$
$\quad \quad a_3=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)}
 7=8+\sqrt{23}-4$
$\quad \quad a_4=8, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac
 {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$
$\quad \quad a_5=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7 (\sqrt{23}+3)}
 {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$

$\quad \quad a_6=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)}
 {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$
$\quad \quad a_7=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)}
 {7}=8+\sqrt{23}-4$
It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use
 the notation $\sqrt{23}=[4;(1,3,1,8)]$, to indicate that the block
 (1,3,1,8) repeats indefinitely.
The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational) square
 roots are:

$\quad \quad \sqrt{2}=[1;(2)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{3}=[1;(1,2)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{5}=[2;(4)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{6}=[2;(2,4)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{7}=[2;(1,1,1,4)]$, period=$4$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{8}=[2;(1,4)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{10}=[3;(6)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{11}=[3;(3,6)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{12}=[3;(2,6)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{13}=[3;(1,1,1,1,6)]$, period=$5$

Exactly four continued fractions, for $N \le 13$, have an odd period.
How many continued fractions for $N \le 10\,000$ have an odd period?

Problem 65
The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.
$\sqrt{2} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2
 + ...}}}}$
The infinite continued fraction can be written, $\sqrt{2} = [1; (2)]$,
 $(2)$ indicates that 2 repeats ad infinitum. In a similar way, $\sqrt{23}
 = [4; (1, 3, 1, 8)]$.
It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions
 for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us
 consider the convergents for $\sqrt{2}$.
$\begin{align}
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{3}{2} \\
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{7}{5}\\
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}} = \dfrac{17}{12}\\
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}} =
 \dfrac{41}{29}
\end{align}$
Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for $\sqrt{2}$ are:
$1, \dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{7}{5}, \dfrac{17}{12}, \dfrac{41}{29},
 \dfrac{99}{70}, \dfrac{239}{169}, \dfrac{577}{408}, \dfrac{1393}{985},
 \dfrac{3363}{2378}, ...$
What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,$e =
 [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, ... , 1, 2k, 1, ...]$.
The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:
$2, 3, \dfrac{8}{3}, \dfrac{11}{4}, \dfrac{19}{7}, \dfrac{87}{32},
 \dfrac{106}{39}, \dfrac{193}{71}, \dfrac{1264}{465}, \dfrac{1457}{536},
 ...$
The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10th convergent is $1 + 4 +
 5 + 7 = 17$.
Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100th convergent of the
 continued fraction for $e$.

Problem 66
Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
x2 – Dy2 = 1
For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 – 13×1802
 = 1.
It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when
 D is square.
By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain
 the following:
32 – 2×22 = 1
22 – 3×12 = 192 – 5×42 = 1
52 – 6×22 = 1
82 – 7×32 = 1
Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D ≤ 7, the largest
 x is obtained when D=5.
Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the
 largest value of x is obtained.

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
Find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt (right click

 with one-hundred rows.
NOTE: This is a much more difficult version of Problem 18. It is not
 possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 299
 altogether! If you could check one trillion (1012) routes every second
 it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an
 efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)

Problem 68
Consider the following "magic" 3-gon ring, filled with the numbers 1 to 6,
 and each line adding to nine.


Working clockwise, and starting from the group of three with the
 numerically lowest external node (4,3,2 in this example), each solution
 can be described uniquely. For example, the above solution can be
 described by the set: 4,3,2; 6,2,1; 5,1,3.
It is possible to complete the ring with four different totals: 9, 10,
 11, and 12. There are eight solutions in total.

TotalSolution Set
94,2,3; 5,3,1; 6,1,2
94,3,2; 6,2,1; 5,1,3
102,3,5; 4,5,1; 6,1,3
102,5,3; 6,3,1; 4,1,5
111,4,6; 3,6,2; 5,2,4

121,5,6; 2,6,4; 3,4,5
121,6,5; 3,5,4; 2,4,6

By concatenating each group it is possible to form 9-digit strings;
 the maximum string for a 3-gon ring is 432621513.
Using the numbers 1 to 10, and depending on arrangements, it is possible
 to form 16- and 17-digit strings. What is the maximum 16-digit string
 for a "magic" 5-gon ring?



Problem 69
Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function],

 less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.

It can be seen that n=6 produces a maximum n/φ(n) for n ≤ 10.
Find the value of n ≤ 1,000,000 for which n/φ(n) is a maximum.

Problem 70
Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function],
 is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal
 to n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7,
 and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.The
 number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number,
 so φ(1)=1.
Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a
 permutation of 79180.
Find the value of n, 1 < n < 107, for which φ(n) is a permutation of
 n and the ratio n/φ(n) produces a minimum.

Problem 71
Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d
 and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending
 order of size, we get:
1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8,
 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.
By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000 in
 ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately
 to the left of 3/7.

Problem 72
Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d
 and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending
 order of size, we get:
1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8,
 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set.
How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper
 fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000?

Problem 73
Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d
 and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending
 order of size, we get:
1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8,
 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.
How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced
 proper fractions for d ≤ 12,000?

Problem 74
The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the
 factorial of its digits is equal to 145:
1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of
 numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three
 such loops that exist:
169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169
871 → 45361 → 871
872 → 45362 → 872
It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually
 get stuck in a loop. For example,
69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454)
78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871)
540 → 145 (→ 145)
Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the
 longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million
 is sixty terms.
How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain
 exactly sixty non-repeating terms?

Problem 75
It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be
 bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way,
 but there are many more examples.
12 cm: (3,4,5)24 cm: (6,8,10)30 cm: (5,12,13)36 cm: (9,12,15)40 cm:
 (8,15,17)48 cm: (12,16,20)
In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an
 integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than
 one solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to
 form exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.
120 cm: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)
Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of L ≤
 1,500,000 can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?

Problem 76
It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:
4 + 1
3 + 2
3 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least
 two positive integers?

Problem 77
It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five
 different ways:
7 + 3
5 + 5
5 + 3 + 2
3 + 3 + 2 + 2
2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in
 over five thousand different ways?

Problem 78
Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can
 be separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into
 piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.

OOOOO
OOOO   O
OOO   OO
OOO   O   O
OO   OO   O
OO   O   O   O

Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.

Problem 79
A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for
 three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode
 was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the
 expected reply would be: 317.
The text file, keylog.txt, contains fifty successful login attempts.
Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse
 the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of
 unknown length.

Problem 80
It is well known that if the square root of a natural number is not an
 integer, then it is irrational. The decimal expansion of such square
 roots is infinite without any repeating pattern at all.
The square root of two is 1.41421356237309504880..., and the digital
 sum of the first one hundred decimal digits is 475.
For the first one hundred natural numbers, find the total of the digital
 sums of the first one hundred decimal digits for all the irrational
 square roots.

Problem 84
In the game, Monopoly, the standard board is set up in the following way:


A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided
 dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise
 direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square
 with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC
 (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.
In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders
 the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive
 doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they
 proceed directly to jail.
At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a
 player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective
 pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom
 of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose
 of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement;
 any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the
 player will remain on the CC/CH square.
Community Chest (2/16 cards):
Advance to GO
Go to JAIL

Chance (10/16 cards):
Advance to GO
Go to JAIL
Go to C1
Go to E3
Go to H2
Go to R1
Go to next R (railway company)
Go to next R
Go to next U (utility company)
Go back 3 squares.

The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular
 square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a
 roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of
 G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares
 will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another
 square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each
 roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between
 "Just Visiting" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the
 rule about requiring a double to "get out of jail", assuming that they
 pay to get out on their next turn.
By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to
 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that
 correspond with sets of squares.
Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in
 order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO
 (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed
 with the six-digit modal string: 102400.
If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find
 the six-digit modal string.

Problem 85
By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring
 3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles:


Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains exactly two
 million rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.

Problem 86
A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by 3,
 and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces
 of the room the shortest "straight line" distance from S to F is 10
 and the path is shown on the diagram.


However, there are up to three "shortest" path candidates for any given
 cuboid and the shortest route doesn't always have integer length.
It can be shown that there are exactly 2060 distinct cuboids, ignoring
 rotations, with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of M by M by M,
 for which the shortest route has integer length when M = 100. This is
 the least value of M for which the number of solutions first exceeds
 two thousand; the number of solutions when M = 99 is 1975.
Find the least value of M such that the number of solutions first exceeds
 one million.

Problem 87
The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube,
 and prime fourth power is 28. In fact, there are exactly four numbers
 below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:
28 = 22 + 23 + 24
33 = 32 + 23 + 24
49 = 52 + 23 + 24
47 = 22 + 33 + 24
How many numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a
 prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power?

Problem 88
A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a
 given set of at least two natural numbers, {a1, a2, ... , ak} is called
 a product-sum number: N = a1 + a2 + ... + ak = a1 × a2 × ... × ak.
For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.
For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this
 property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers
 for sets of size, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.
k=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2k=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3k=4: 8 = 1 × 1
 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4k=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2  = 1 + 1 + 2 +
 2 + 2k=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6
Hence for 2≤k≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is
 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.
In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12
 is {4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.
What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12000?

Problem 89
For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are
 basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some
 numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a "best"
 way of writing a particular number.
For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing
 the number sixteen:
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
VIIIIIIIIIII
VVIIIIII
XIIIIII
VVVI
XVI
However, according to the rules only XIIIIII and XVI are valid, and the
 last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the
 least number of numerals.
The 11K text file, roman.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
 contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily
 minimal, Roman numerals; see About... Roman Numerals for the definitive
 rules for this problem.
Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their
 minimal form.
Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no
 more than four consecutive identical units.

Problem 90
Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written
 on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes
 side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit
 numbers.
For example, the square number 64 could be formed:


In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible
 to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09,
 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.
For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8,
 9} on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.
However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned
 upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1,
 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed;
 otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09.
In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits
 on each cube, not the order.
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct
 sets in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4,
 5, 6, 9} for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.
How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the
 square numbers to be displayed?

Problem 91
The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates
 and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.


There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can
 be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that
 is,0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 2.


Given that 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 50, how many right triangles can
 be formed?

Problem 92
A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits
 in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.
For example,
44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → 1 → 1
85 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89
Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an
 endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will
 eventually arrive at 1 or 89.
How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?

Problem 93
By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once,
 and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /)
 and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive
 integer targets.
For example,
8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2
14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)
19 = 4 * (2 + 3) − 1
36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)
Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.
Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different
 target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the numbers 1 to
 28 can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.
Find the set of four distinct digits, a < b < c < d, for which the
 longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to n, can be obtained,
 giving your answer as a string: abcd.

Problem 94
It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral
 length sides and integral area. However, the almost equilateral triangle
 5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units.
We shall define an almost equilateral triangle to be a triangle for
 which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.
Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with
 integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one
 billion (1,000,000,000).

Problem 95
The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number
 itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As
 the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.
Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of
 the proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For
 this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.
Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with
 12496, we form a chain of five numbers:
12496 → 14288 → 15472 → 14536 → 14264 (→ 12496 → ...)
Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable
 chain.
Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element
 exceeding one million.

Problem 96
Su Doku (Japanese meaning number place) is the name given to a popular
 puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to
 Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle
 idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however,
 is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each
 row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below
 is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.

     
A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be
 solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test"
 methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion
 over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty
 of the puzzle; the example above is considered easy because it can be
 solved by straight forward direct deduction.
The 6K text file, sudoku.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
 contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty,
 but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the
 example above).
By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found
 in the top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the
 3-digit number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.

Problem 97
The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered
 in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form 26972593−1; it contains
 exactly 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the
 form 2p−1, have been found which contain more digits.
However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which
 contains 2,357,207 digits: 28433×27830457+1.
Find the last ten digits of this prime number.

Problem 98
By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9, and 6
 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 362. What is remarkable
 is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE,
 also forms a square number: 9216 = 962. We shall call CARE (and RACE)
 a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are
 not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital
 value as another letter.
Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text
 file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the
 square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be
 an anagram of itself).
What is the largest square number formed by any member of such a pair?
NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given text file.

Problem 99
Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not
 difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 < 37 = 2187.
However, confirming that 632382518061 > 519432525806 would be much more
 difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.
Using base_exp.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K
 text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on
 each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.
NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the
 example given above.

Problem 100
If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen
 blue discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random,
 it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) =
 (15/21)×(14/20) = 1/2.
The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of
 taking two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue
 discs and thirty-five red discs.
By finding the first arrangement to contain over 1012 = 1,000,000,000,000
 discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would
 contain.

Problem 101
If we are presented with the first k terms of a sequence it is impossible
 to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely
 many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.
As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is
 defined by the generating function, un = n3: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ...
Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working
 on the principle that "simple is best" we should assume a linear
 relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference
 7). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same
 principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.
We shall define OP(k, n) to be the nth term of the optimum polynomial
 generating function for the first k terms of a sequence. It should be
 clear that OP(k, n) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence
 for n ≤ k, and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be OP(k,
 k+1); in which case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).
As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be
 most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for n ≥ 2, OP(1, n) = u1.
Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:

OP(1, n) = 1
1, 1, 1, 1, ...
OP(2, n) = 7n−6
1, 8, 15, ...
OP(3, n) = 6n2−11n+6     
1, 8, 27, 58, ...
OP(4, n) = n3
1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...

Clearly no BOPs exist for k ≥ 4.
By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in red
 above), we obtain 1 + 15 + 58 = 74.
Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:
un = 1 − n + n2 − n3 + n4 − n5 + n6 − n7 + n8 − n9 + n10
Find the sum of FITs for the BOPs.

Problem 102
Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for
 which -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.
Consider the following two triangles:
A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)
X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)
It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle
 XYZ does not.
Using triangles.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K
 text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles,
 find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.
NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the
 example given above.

Problem 103
Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall
 call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets,
 B and C, the following properties are true:
S(B) ≠ S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
If S(A) is minimised for a given n, we shall call it an optimum special
 sum set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.
n = 1: {1}n = 2: {1, 2}n = 3: {2, 3, 4}n = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}n = 5: {6, 9,
 11, 12, 13}
It seems that for a given optimum set, A = {a1, a2, ... , an}, the next
 optimum set is of the form B = {b, a1+b, a2+b, ... ,an+b}, where b is
 the "middle" element on the previous row.
By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for n = 6 to be
 A = {11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24}, with S(A) = 117. However, this is not
 the optimum set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a
 near optimum set. The optimum set for n = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20,
 22, 25}, with S(A) = 115 and corresponding set string: 111819202225.
Given that A is an optimum special sum set for n = 7, find its set string.
NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 105 and Problem 106.

Problem 104
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
It turns out that F541, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci
 number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all
 the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F2749, which
 contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first
 nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.
Given that Fk is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine
 digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.

Problem 105
Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall
 call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets,
 B and C, the following properties are true:
S(B) ≠ S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
For example, {81, 88, 75, 42, 87, 84, 86, 65} is not a special sum set
 because 65 + 87 + 88 = 75 + 81 + 84, whereas {157, 150, 164, 119, 79,
 159, 161, 139, 158} satisfies both rules for all possible subset pair
 combinations and S(A) = 1286.
Using sets.txt (right click and "Save Link/Target As..."), a 4K text
 file with one-hundred sets containing seven to twelve elements (the two
 examples given above are the first two sets in the file), identify all
 the special sum sets, A1, A2, ..., Ak, and find the value of S(A1) +
 S(A2) + ... + S(Ak).
NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 106.

Problem 106
Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall
 call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets,
 B and C, the following properties are true:
S(B) ≠ S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly
 increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.
Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained
 from a set for which n = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested
 for equality (first rule). Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 out of the
 966 subset pairs need to be tested.
For n = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained
 need to be tested for equality?
NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 105.

Problem 107
The following undirected network consists of seven vertices and twelve
 edges with a total weight of 243.


The same network can be represented by the matrix below.
    ABCDEFG
A-161221---
B16--1720--
C12--28-31-
D211728-181923
E-20-18--11
F--3119--27
G---231127-
However, it is possible to optimise the network by removing some edges and
 still ensure that all points on the network remain connected. The network
 which achieves the maximum saving is shown below. It has a weight of 93,
 representing a saving of 243 − 93 = 150 from the original network.


Using network.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 6K text
 file containing a network with forty vertices, and given in matrix form,
 find the maximum saving which can be achieved by removing redundant
 edges whilst ensuring that the network remains connected.

Problem 108
In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.
$$\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$
For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:
$$\begin{align}
\dfrac{1}{5} + \dfrac{1}{20} &= \dfrac{1}{4}\\
\dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{1}{12} &= \dfrac{1}{4}\\
\dfrac{1}{8} + \dfrac{1}{8} &= \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{align}
$$

What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions
 exceeds one-thousand?
NOTE: This problem is an easier version of Problem 110; it is strongly
 advised that you solve this one first.

Problem 109
In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which
 is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.


The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the
 dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores
 zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single
 scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double
 and treble scores respectively.
At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull
 region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner
 bull is a double, worth 50 points.
There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the
 players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce
 their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a
 "doubles out" system, which means that the player must land a double
 (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their
 final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total
 to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is "bust".
When a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a
 "checkout" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble
 20s and double bull).
There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:

     
     
     
D3D1D2S2D2D2D1S4D1S1S1D2S1T1D1S1S3D1D1D1D1D1S2D1S2S2D1
Note that D1 D2 is considered different to D2 D1 as they finish on
 different doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the
 same as T1 S1 D1.
In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations;
 for example, D3 is the same as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.
Incredibly there are 42336 distinct ways of checking out in total.
How many distinct ways can a player checkout with a score less than 100?

Problem 110
In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.
$$\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$
It can be verified that when $n = 1260$ there are 113 distinct solutions
 and this is the least value of $n$ for which the total number of distinct
 solutions exceeds one hundred.
What is the least value of $n$ for which the number of distinct solutions
 exceeds four million?
NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of Problem 108 and as
 it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires
 a clever implementation.

Problem 111
Considering 4-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that
 they cannot all be the same: 1111 is divisible by 11, 2222 is divisible
 by 22, and so on. But there are nine 4-digit primes containing three
 ones:
1117, 1151, 1171, 1181, 1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111
We shall say that M(n, d) represents the maximum number of repeated
 digits for an n-digit prime where d is the repeated digit, N(n, d)
 represents the number of such primes, and S(n, d) represents the sum
 of these primes.
So M(4, 1) = 3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit
 prime where one is the repeated digit, there are N(4, 1) = 9 such
 primes, and the sum of these primes is S(4, 1) = 22275. It turns out
 that for d = 0, it is only possible to have M(4, 0) = 2 repeated digits,
 but there are N(4, 0) = 13 such cases.
In the same way we obtain the following results for 4-digit primes.

Digit, d
M(4, d)
N(4, d)
S(4, d)

For d = 0 to 9, the sum of all S(4, d) is 273700.
Find the sum of all S(10, d).

Problem 112
Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its
 left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.
Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called
 a decreasing number; for example, 66420.
We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing
 a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.
Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just
 over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact,
 the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first
 reaches 50% is 538.
Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time
 we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.
Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is
 exactly 99%.

Problem 113
Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its
 left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.
Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called
 a decreasing number; for example, 66420.
We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing
 a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.
As n increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below n increases such
 that there are only 12951 numbers below one-million that are not bouncy
 and only 277032 non-bouncy numbers below 1010.
How many numbers below a googol (10100) are not bouncy?

Problem 114
A row measuring seven units in length has red blocks with a minimum
 length of three units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which
 are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one grey
 square. There are exactly seventeen ways of doing this.


How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be filled?
NOTE: Although the example above does not lend itself to the possibility,
 in general it is permitted to mix block sizes. For example, on a row
 measuring eight units in length you could use red (3), grey (1), and red
 (4).

Problem 115
NOTE: This is a more difficult version of Problem 114.
A row measuring n units in length has red blocks with a minimum length
 of m units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed
 to be different lengths) are separated by at least one black square.
Let the fill-count function, F(m, n), represent the number of ways that
 a row can be filled.
For example, F(3, 29) = 673135 and F(3, 30) = 1089155.
That is, for m = 3, it can be seen that n = 30 is the smallest value
 for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.
In the same way, for m = 10, it can be verified that F(10, 56) = 880711
 and F(10, 57) = 1148904, so n = 57 is the least value for which the
 fill-count function first exceeds one million.
For m = 50, find the least value of n for which the fill-count function
 first exceeds one million.

Problem 116
A row of five grey square tiles is to have a number of its tiles replaced
 with coloured oblong tiles chosen from red (length two), green (length
 three), or blue (length four).
If red tiles are chosen there are exactly seven ways this can be done.


If green tiles are chosen there are three ways.


And if blue tiles are chosen there are two ways.


Assuming that colours cannot be mixed there are 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 ways of
 replacing the grey tiles in a row measuring five units in length.
How many different ways can the grey tiles in a row measuring fifty
 units in length be replaced if colours cannot be mixed and at least
 one coloured tile must be used?
NOTE: This is related to Problem 117.

Problem 117
Using a combination of grey square tiles and oblong tiles chosen from:
 red tiles (measuring two units), green tiles (measuring three units),
 and blue tiles (measuring four units), it is possible to tile a row
 measuring five units in length in exactly fifteen different ways.


How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be tiled?
NOTE: This is related to Problem 116.

Problem 118
Using all of the digits 1 through 9 and concatenating them freely to form
 decimal integers, different sets can be formed. Interestingly with the
 set {2,5,47,89,631}, all of the elements belonging to it are prime.
How many distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine
 exactly once contain only prime elements?

Problem 119
The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits
 raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 83 = 512. Another example of
 a number with this property is 614656 = 284.
We shall define an to be the nth term of this sequence and insist that
 a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.
You are given that a2 = 512 and a10 = 614656.
Find a30.

Problem 120
Let r be the remainder when (a−1)n + (a+1)n is divided by a2.
For example, if a = 7 and n = 3, then r = 42: 63 + 83 = 728 ≡ 42 mod
 49. And as n varies, so too will r, but for a = 7 it turns out that
 rmax = 42.
For 3 ≤ a ≤ 1000, find ∑ rmax.

Problem 121
A bag contains one red disc and one blue disc. In a game of chance a
 player takes a disc at random and its colour is noted. After each turn
 the disc is returned to the bag, an extra red disc is added, and another
 disc is taken at random.
The player pays £1 to play and wins if they have taken more blue discs
 than red discs at the end of the game.
If the game is played for four turns, the probability of a player winning
 is exactly 11/120, and so the maximum prize fund the banker should
 allocate for winning in this game would be £10 before they would
 expect to incur a loss. Note that any payout will be a whole number
 of pounds and also includes the original £1 paid to play the game,
 so in the example given the player actually wins £9.
Find the maximum prize fund that should be allocated to a single game
 in which fifteen turns are played.

Problem 122
The most naive way of computing n15 requires fourteen multiplications:
n × n × ... × n = n15
But using a "binary" method you can compute it in six multiplications:
n × n = n2n2 × n2 = n4n4 × n4 = n8n8 × n4 = n12n12 × n2 = n14n14
 × n = n15
However it is yet possible to compute it in only five multiplications:
n × n = n2n2 × n = n3n3 × n3 = n6n6 × n6 = n12n12 × n3 = n15
We shall define m(k) to be the minimum number of multiplications to
 compute nk; for example m(15) = 5.
For 1 ≤ k ≤ 200, find ∑ m(k).

Problem 123
Let pn be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be the remainder
 when (pn−1)n + (pn+1)n is divided by pn2.
For example, when n = 3, p3 = 5, and 43 + 63 = 280 ≡ 5 mod 25.
The least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 109 is 7037.
Find the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 1010.

Problem 124
The radical of n, rad(n), is the product of the distinct prime factors
 of n. For example, 504 = 23 × 32 × 7, so rad(504) = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.
If we calculate rad(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, then sort them on rad(n),
 and sorting on n if the radical values are equal, we get:

Let E(k) be the kth element in the sorted n column; for example, E(4)
 = 8 and E(6) = 9.
If rad(n) is sorted for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, find E(10000).

Problem 125
The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as
 the sum of consecutive squares: 62 + 72 + 82 + 92 + 102 + 112 + 122.
There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be
 written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes
 is 4164. Note that 1 = 02 + 12 has not been included as this problem
 is concerned with the squares of positive integers.
Find the sum of all the numbers less than 108 that are both palindromic
 and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.

Problem 126
The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid
 measuring 3 x 2 x 1 is twenty-two.


If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six
 cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require
 seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred
 and eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.
However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5 x 1 x 1 also
 requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring
 5 x 3 x 1, 7 x 2 x 1, and 11 x 1 x 1 all contain forty-six
 cubes.
We shall define C(n) to represent the number of cuboids that contain
 n cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5,
 and C(118) = 8.
It turns out that 154 is the least value of n for which C(n) = 10.
Find the least value of n for which C(n) = 1000.

Problem 127
The radical of n, rad(n), is the product of distinct prime factors of
 n. For example, 504 = 23 × 32 × 7, so rad(504) = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.
We shall define the triplet of positive integers (a, b, c) to be an
 abc-hit if:
GCD(a, b) = GCD(a, c) = GCD(b, c) = 1
a < b
a + b = c
rad(abc) < c
For example, (5, 27, 32) is an abc-hit, because:
GCD(5, 27) = GCD(5, 32) = GCD(27, 32) = 1
5 < 27
5 + 27 = 32
rad(4320) = 30 < 32
It turns out that abc-hits are quite rare and there are only thirty-one
 abc-hits for c < 1000, with ∑c = 12523.
Find ∑c for c < 120000.

Problem 128
A hexagonal tile with number 1 is surrounded by a ring of six hexagonal
 tiles, starting at "12 o'clock" and numbering the tiles 2 to 7 in an
 anti-clockwise direction.
New rings are added in the same fashion, with the next rings being
 numbered 8 to 19, 20 to 37, 38 to 61, and so on. The diagram below
 shows the first three rings.


By finding the difference between tile n and each of its six neighbours we
 shall define PD(n) to be the number of those differences which are prime.
For example, working clockwise around tile 8 the differences are 12,
 29, 11, 6, 1, and 13. So PD(8) = 3.
In the same way, the differences around tile 17 are 1, 17, 16, 1, 11,
 and 10, hence PD(17) = 2.
It can be shown that the maximum value of PD(n) is 3.
If all of the tiles for which PD(n) = 3 are listed in ascending order
 to form a sequence, the 10th tile would be 271.
Find the 2000th tile in this sequence.

Problem 129
A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
 R(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, R(6) = 111111.
Given that n is a positive integer and GCD(n, 10) = 1, it can be shown
 that there always exists a value, k, for which R(k) is divisible by n,
 and let A(n) be the least such value of k; for example, A(7) = 6 and
 A(41) = 5.
The least value of n for which A(n) first exceeds ten is 17.
Find the least value of n for which A(n) first exceeds one-million.

Problem 130
A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
 R(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, R(6) = 111111.
Given that n is a positive integer and GCD(n, 10) = 1, it can be shown
 that there always exists a value, k, for which R(k) is divisible by n,
 and let A(n) be the least such value of k; for example, A(7) = 6 and
 A(41) = 5.
You are given that for all primes, p > 5, that p − 1 is divisible by
 A(p). For example, when p = 41, A(41) = 5, and 40 is divisible by 5.
However, there are rare composite values for which this is also true;
 the first five examples being 91, 259, 451, 481, and 703.
Find the sum of the first twenty-five composite values of n for
 whichGCD(n, 10) = 1 and n − 1 is divisible by A(n).

Problem 131
There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer,
 n, such that the expression n3 + n2p is a perfect cube.
For example, when p = 19, 83 + 82×19 = 123.
What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property
 the value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below
 one-hundred.
How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?

Problem 132
A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
 R(k) to be a repunit of length k.
For example, R(10) = 1111111111 = 11×41×271×9091, and the sum of
 these prime factors is 9414.
Find the sum of the first forty prime factors of R(109).

Problem 133
A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
 R(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, R(6) = 111111.
Let us consider repunits of the form R(10n).
Although R(10), R(100), or R(1000) are not divisible by 17, R(10000)
 is divisible by 17. Yet there is no value of n for which R(10n) will
 divide by 19. In fact, it is remarkable that 11, 17, 41, and 73 are
 the only four primes below one-hundred that can  be a factor of R(10n).
Find the sum of all the primes below one-hundred thousand that will
 never be a factor of R(10n).

Problem 134
Consider the consecutive primes p1 = 19 and p2 = 23. It can be verified
 that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are formed
 by p1 whilst also being divisible by p2.
In fact, with the exception of p1 = 3 and p2 = 5, for every pair of
 consecutive primes, p2 > p1, there exist values of n for which the last
 digits are formed by p1 and n is divisible by p2. Let S be the smallest
 of these values of n.
Find ∑ S for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 ≤ p1 ≤ 1000000.

Problem 135
Given the positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an
 arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, n,
 for which the equation, x2 − y2 − z2 = n, has exactly two solutions
 is n = 27:
342 − 272 − 202 = 122 − 92 − 62 = 27
It turns out that n = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten
 solutions.
How many values of n less than one million have exactly ten distinct
 solutions?

Problem 136
The positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic
 progression. Given that n is a positive integer, the equation, x2 −
 y2 − z2 = n, has exactly one solution when n = 20:
132 − 102 − 72 = 20
In fact there are twenty-five values of n below one hundred for which
 the equation has a unique solution.
How many values of n less than fifty million have exactly one solution?

Problem 137
Consider the infinite polynomial series $A_F(x) = x F_1 + x^2 F_2 + x^3
 F_3 + \dots$, where $F_k$ is the $k$th term in the Fibonacci sequence:
 $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \dots$; that is, $F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}$, $F_1 =
 1$ and $F_2 = 1$.
For this problem we shall be interested in values of $x$ for which
 $A_F(x)$ is a positive integer.
Surprisingly$\begin{align*}
A_F(\tfrac{1}{2}) &= (\tfrac{1}{2})\times 1 + (\tfrac{1}{2})^2\times
 1 + (\tfrac{1}{2})^3\times 2 + (\tfrac{1}{2})^4\times 3 +
 (\tfrac{1}{2})^5\times 5 + \cdots \\ &= \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{4} +
 \tfrac{2}{8} + \tfrac{3}{16} + \tfrac{5}{32} + \cdots \\ &= 2
\end{align*}$
The corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are
 shown below.

$x$$A_F(x)$
$\sqrt{2}-1$1
$\tfrac{1}{2}$2
$\frac{\sqrt{13}-2}{3}$3
$\frac{\sqrt{89}-5}{8}$4
$\frac{\sqrt{34}-3}{5}$5

We shall call $A_F(x)$ a golden nugget if $x$ is rational, because
 they become increasingly rarer; for example, the 10th golden nugget
 is 74049690.
Find the 15th golden nugget.

Problem 138
Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, $b = 16$, and legs,
 $L = 17$.


By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the
 triangle, $h = \sqrt{17^2 - 8^2} = 15$, which is one less than the
 base length.
With $b = 272$ and $L = 305$, we get $h = 273$, which is one more than
 the base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle
 with the property that $h = b \pm 1$.
Find $\sum L$ for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which $h =
 b \pm 1$ and $b$, $L$ are positive integers.

Problem 139
Let (a, b, c) represent the three sides of a right angle triangle with
 integral length sides. It is possible to place four such triangles
 together to form a square with length c.
For example, (3, 4, 5) triangles can be placed together to form a 5 by
 5 square with a 1 by 1 hole in the middle and it can be seen that the
 5 by 5 square can be tiled with twenty-five 1 by 1 squares.


However, if (5, 12, 13) triangles were used then the hole would measure
 7 by 7 and these could not be used to tile the 13 by 13 square.
Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less than one-hundred
 million, how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a tiling to
 take place?

Problem 140
Consider the infinite polynomial series $A_G(x) = x G_1 + x^2 G_2 +
 x^3 G_3 + \cdots$, where $G_k$ is the $k$th term of the second order
 recurrence relation $G_k = G_{k-1} + G_{k-2}$, $G_1 = 1$ and $G_2 =
 4$; that is, $1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 23, \dots$ .
For this problem we shall be concerned with values of $x$ for which
 $A_G(x)$ is a positive integer.
The corresponding values of $x$ for the first five natural numbers are
 shown below.

$x$$A_G(x)$
$\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{4}$1
$\tfrac{2}{5}$2
$\frac{\sqrt{22}-2}{6}$3
$\frac{\sqrt{137}-5}{14}$4
$\tfrac{1}{2}$5

We shall call $A_G(x)$ a golden nugget if $x$ is rational, because
 they become increasingly rarer; for example, the 20th golden nugget
 is 211345365.
Find the sum of the first thirty golden nuggets.

Problem 141
A positive integer, n, is divided by d and the quotient and remainder are
 q and r respectively. In addition d, q, and r are consecutive positive
 integer terms in a geometric sequence, but not necessarily in that order.
For example, 58 divided by 6 has quotient 9 and remainder 4. It can
 also be seen that 4, 6, 9 are consecutive terms in a geometric sequence
 (common ratio 3/2).
We will call such numbers, n, progressive.
Some progressive numbers, such as 9 and 10404 = 1022, happen to also be
 perfect squares. The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one
 hundred thousand is 124657.
Find the sum of all progressive perfect squares below one trillion (1012).

Problem 142
Find the smallest x + y + z with integers x > y > z > 0 such that x +
 y, x − y, x + z, x − z, y + z, y − z are all perfect squares.

Problem 143
Let ABC be a triangle with all interior angles being less than 120
 degrees. Let X be any point inside the triangle and let XA = p, XC =
 q, and XB = r.
Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of X such that p +
 q + r was minimised.
Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles AOB, BNC and
 AMC are constructed on each side of triangle ABC, the circumscribed
 circles of AOB, BNC, and AMC will intersect at a single point, T, inside
 the triangle. Moreover he proved that T, called the Torricelli/Fermat
 point, minimises p + q + r. Even more remarkable, it can be shown
 that when the sum is minimised, AN = BM = CO = p + q + r and that AN,
 BM and CO also intersect at T.

If the sum is minimised and a, b, c, p, q and r are all positive integers
 we shall call triangle ABC a Torricelli triangle. For example, a = 399,
 b = 455, c = 511 is an example of a Torricelli triangle, with p + q +
 r = 784.
Find the sum of all distinct values of p + q + r ≤ 120000 for Torricelli
 triangles.

Problem 144
In laser physics, a "white cell" is a mirror system that acts as a delay
 line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on
 the mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.
The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the
 equation 4x2 + y2 = 100
The section corresponding to −0.01 ≤ x ≤ +0.01 at the top is
 missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.

The light beam in this problem starts at the point (0.0,10.1) just outside
 the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at (1.4,-9.6).
Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows
 the usual law of reflection "angle of incidence equals angle of
 reflection." That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the
 same angle with the normal line at the point of incidence.
In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of
 contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue
 line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence
 of the first bounce.The slope m of the tangent line at any point (x,y)
 of the given ellipse is: m = −4x/yThe normal line is perpendicular
 to this tangent line at the point of incidence.
The animation on the right shows the first 10 reflections of the beam.
How many times does the beam hit the internal surface of the white cell
 before exiting?

Problem 145
Some positive integers n have the property that the sum [ n + reverse(n)
 ] consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, 36 + 63 =
 99 and 409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers reversible; so 36,
 63, 409, and 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in
 either n or reverse(n).
There are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand.
How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (109)?

Problem 146
The smallest positive integer n for which the numbers n2+1, n2+3, n2+7,
 n2+9, n2+13, and n2+27 are consecutive primes is 10. The sum of all
 such integers n below one-million is 1242490.
What is the sum of all such integers n below 150 million?

Problem 147
In a 3x2 cross-hatched grid, a total of 37 different rectangles could
 be situated within that grid as indicated in the sketch.

There are 5 grids smaller than 3x2, vertical and horizontal dimensions
 being important, i.e. 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 1x2 and 2x2. If each of them is
 cross-hatched, the following number of different rectangles could be
 situated within those smaller grids:
1x112x143x181x242x218Adding those to the 37 of the 3x2 grid, a total of
 72 different rectangles could be situated within 3x2 and smaller grids.
How many different rectangles could be situated within 47x43 and smaller
 grids?

Problem 148

However, if we check the first one hundred rows, we will find that only

Find the number of entries which are not divisible by 7 in the first
 one billion (109) rows of Pascal's triangle.

Problem 149
Looking at the table below, it is easy to verify that the maximum possible
 sum of adjacent numbers in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal
 or anti-diagonal) is 16 (= 8 + 7 + 1).

−25329−6513273−18−4  8
Now, let us repeat the search, but on a much larger scale:
First, generate four million pseudo-random numbers using a specific form
 of what is known as a "Lagged Fibonacci Generator":
For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, sk = [100003 − 200003k + 300007k3] (modulo 1000000)
 − 500000.
For 56 ≤ k ≤ 4000000, sk = [sk−24 + sk−55 + 1000000] (modulo
 1000000) − 500000.
Thus, s10 = −393027 and s100 = 86613.
The terms of s are then arranged in a 2000×2000 table, using the first
 2000 numbers to fill the first row (sequentially), the next 2000 numbers
 to fill the second row, and so on.
Finally, find the greatest sum of (any number of) adjacent entries in
 any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal).

Problem 150
In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to
 find a sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is
 the smallest possible.
In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked triangle
 satisfies this condition having a sum of −42.


We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so we
 generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers sk in the range ±219, using a type
 of random number generator (known as a Linear Congruential Generator)
 as follows:
t := 0

for k = 1 up to k = 500500:

    t := (615949*t + 797807) modulo 220
    sk := t−219
Thus: s1 = 273519, s2 = −153582, s3 = 450905 etc
Our triangular array is then formed using the pseudo-random numbers thus:

s1
s2  s3
s4  s5  s6 

s7  s8  s9  s10
...

Sub-triangles can start at any element of the array and extend down as
 far as we like (taking-in the two elements directly below it from the
 next row, the three elements directly below from the row after that,
 and so on).

The "sum of a sub-triangle" is defined as the sum of all the elements
 it contains.

Find the smallest possible sub-triangle sum.

Problem 151
A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires
 a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.
Every Monday morning, the supervisor opens a new envelope, containing
 a large sheet of the special paper with size A1.
The supervisor proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of
 size A2. Then one of the sheets is cut in half to get two sheets of
 size A3 and so on until an A5-size sheet is obtained, which is needed
 for the first batch of the week.
All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.

At the beginning of each subsequent batch, the supervisor takes from
 the envelope one sheet of paper at random. If it is of size A5, then it
 is used. If it is larger, then the 'cut-in-half' procedure is repeated
 until an A5-size sheet is obtained, and any remaining sheets are always
 placed back in the envelope.
Excluding the first and last batch of the week, find the expected number
 of times (during each week) that the supervisor finds a single sheet
 of paper in the envelope.
Give your answer rounded to six decimal places using the format x.xxxxxx .

Problem 152
There are several ways to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse
 squares using distinct integers.
For instance, the numbers {2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35} can be used:
$$\begin{align}\dfrac{1}{2} &= \dfrac{1}{2^2} + \dfrac{1}{3^2} +
 \dfrac{1}{4^2} + \dfrac{1}{5^2} +\\
&\quad \dfrac{1}{7^2} + \dfrac{1}{12^2} + \dfrac{1}{15^2} +
 \dfrac{1}{20^2} +\\
&\quad \dfrac{1}{28^2} + \dfrac{1}{35^2}\end{align}$$
In fact, only using integers between 2 and 45 inclusive, there
 are exactly three ways to do it, the remaining two being:
 {2,3,4,6,7,9,10,20,28,35,36,45} and {2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45}.
How many ways are there to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse
 squares using distinct integers between 2 and 80 inclusive?

Problem 153
As we all know the equation x2=-1 has no solutions for real x.

If we however introduce the imaginary number i this equation has two
 solutions: x=i and x=-i.

If we go a step further the equation (x-3)2=-4 has two complex solutions:
 x=3+2i and x=3-2i.
x=3+2i and x=3-2i are called each others' complex conjugate.

Numbers of the form a+bi are called complex numbers.

In general a+bi and a−bi are each other's complex conjugate.
A Gaussian Integer is a complex number a+bi such that both a and b
 are integers.

The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with b=0).

To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with b ≠ 0 we call such
 integers "rational integers."

A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer n if the
 result is also a Gaussian integer.

If for example we divide 5 by 1+2i we can simplify $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}$
 in the following manner:

Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2i:
 1−2i.

The result is $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i} = \dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 -
 2i} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (2i)^2} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (-4)} =
 \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{5} = 1 - 2i$.

So 1+2i is a divisor of 5.

Note that 1+i is not a divisor of 5 because $\dfrac{5}{1 + i} =
 \dfrac{5}{2} - \dfrac{5}{2}i$.

Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (a+bi) is a divisor of a rational
 integer n, then its complex conjugate (a−bi) is also a divisor of n.
In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1,
 1 + 2i, 1 − 2i, 2 + i, 2 − i, 5}.

The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five
 positive rational integers:

n Gaussian integer divisors

51, 1+2i, 1-2i, 2+i, 2-i, 512
For divisors with positive real parts, then, we have: $\sum \limits_{n =
 1}^{5} {s(n)} = 35$.
For $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{10^5} {s(n)} = 17924657155$.
What is $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{10^8} {s(n)}$?

Problem 154
A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each
 ball rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.

Then, we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each
 position:
A path starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three
 spheres directly below the current position.
Consequently, the number of paths to reach a certain position is the
 sum of the numbers immediately above it (depending on the position,
 there are up to three numbers above it).
The result is Pascal's pyramid and the numbers at each level n are the
 coefficients of the trinomial expansion
(x + y + z)n.
How many coefficients in the expansion of (x + y + z)200000 are multiples
 of 1012?

Problem 155
An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same
 value C.

The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form
 sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with
 other capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so
 on up to a final circuit.
Using this simple procedure and up to n identical capacitors, we can
 make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For
 example, using up to n=3 capacitors of 60 $\mu$ F each, we can obtain
 the following 7 distinct total capacitance values:

If we denote by D(n) the number of distinct total capacitance values we
 can obtain when using up to n equal-valued capacitors and the simple
 procedure described above, we have: D(1)=1, D(2)=3, D(3)=7 ...
Find D(18).
Reminder : When connecting capacitors C1, C2 etc in parallel, the total
 capacitance is CT = C1 + C2 +...,

whereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given
 by: $\dfrac{1}{C_T} = \dfrac{1}{C_1} + \dfrac{1}{C_2} + ...$

Problem 156
Starting from zero the natural numbers are written down in base 10
 like this:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12....

Consider the digit d=1. After we write down each number n, we will update
 the number of ones that have occurred and call this number f(n,1). The
 first values for f(n,1), then, are as follows:

nf(n,1)
00
11
21
31
41
51
61
71
81
91
102
114
125

Note that f(n,1) never equals 3.

So the first two solutions of the equation f(n,1)=n are n=0 and n=1. The
 next solution is n=199981.
In the same manner the function f(n,d) gives the total number of digits
 d that have been written down after the number n has been written.

In fact, for every digit d ≠ 0, 0 is the first solution of the equation
 f(n,d)=n.
Let s(d) be the sum of all the solutions for which f(n,d)=n.

You are given that s(1)=22786974071.
Find  ∑ s(d) for 1 ≤ d ≤ 9.
Note: if, for some n, f(n,d)=n for more than one value of d this value
 of n is counted again for every value of d for which f(n,d)=n.

Problem 157
Consider the diophantine equation 1/a+1/b= p/10n with a, b, p, n positive

For n=1 this equation has 20 solutions that are listed below:

1/1+1/2=15/10
1/1+1/5=12/10
1/1+1/10=11/10

1/12+1/60=1/10
1/14+1/35=1/10
1/15+1/30=1/10
1/20+1/20=1/10
How many solutions has this equation for 1 ≤ n ≤ 9?

Problem 158
Taking three different letters from the 26 letters of the alphabet,
 character strings of length three can be formed.
Examples are 'abc', 'hat' and 'zyx'.
When we study these three examples we see that for 'abc' two characters
 come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
For 'hat' there is exactly one character that comes lexicographically
 after its neighbour to the left. For 'zyx' there are zero characters
 that come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
In all there are 10400 strings of length 3 for which exactly one character
 comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
We now consider strings of n ≤ 26 different characters from the
 alphabet.
For every n, p(n) is the number of strings of length n for which exactly
 one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
What is the maximum value of p(n)?

Problem 159
A composite number can be factored many different ways.
For instance, not including multiplication by one, 24 can be factored
 in 7 distinct ways:

24 = 2x2x2x3
24 = 2x3x4
24 = 2x2x6
24 = 4x6
24 = 3x8
24 = 2x12
24 = 24

Recall that the digital root of a number, in base 10, is found by adding
 together the digits of that number,
and repeating that process until a number is arrived at that is less
 than 10.
Thus the digital root of 467 is 8.
We shall call a Digital Root Sum (DRS) the sum of the digital roots of
 the individual factors of our number.  The chart below demonstrates
 all of the DRS values for 24.
FactorisationDigital Root Sum2x2x2x392x3x492x2x6104x6103x8112x125246The
 maximum Digital Root Sum  of 24 is 11.
The function mdrs(n) gives the maximum Digital Root Sum of n. So
 mdrs(24)=11.
Find ∑ mdrs(n) for 1 < n < 1,000,000.

Problem 160
For any N, let f(N) be the last five digits before the trailing zeroes
 in N!.
For example,
9! = 362880 so f(9)=36288
10! = 3628800 so f(10)=36288
20! = 2432902008176640000 so f(20)=17664
Find f(1,000,000,000,000)

Problem 161
A triomino is a shape consisting of three squares joined via the edges.
There are two basic forms:

If all possible orientations are taken into account there are six:

Any n by m grid for which nxm is divisible by 3 can be tiled with
 triominoes.
If we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation
 from another tiling as different there are 41 ways a 2 by 9 grid can
 be  tiled with triominoes:

In how many ways can a 9 by 12 grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?

Problem 162
In  the hexadecimal number system numbers are represented using 16
 different digits:
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
The hexadecimal number AF when written in the decimal number system
 equals 10x16+15=175.
In the 3-digit hexadecimal numbers 10A, 1A0, A10, and A01 the digits
 0,1 and A are all present.

 not 0000001A3F)

Problem 163
Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from
 each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the size 1
 triangle in the sketch below.

Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or
 location can now be observed in that triangle. Using size 1 triangles
 as building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the size 2
 triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either
 different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed
 in that size 2 triangle.
It can be observed that the size 2 triangle contains 4 size 1 triangle
 building blocks. A size 3 triangle would contain 9 size 1 triangle
 building blocks and a size n triangle would thus contain n2 size 1
 triangle building blocks.
If we denote T(n) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of
 size n, then
T(1) = 16
T(2) = 104
Find T(36).

Problem 164
How many 20 digit numbers n (without any leading zero) exist such that
 no three consecutive digits of n have a sum greater than 9?

Problem 165
A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints. By considering two
 line segments in plane geometry there are three possibilities:
the segments have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points
 in common.
Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might
 be the case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the
 segments or of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint
 of either of the segments it is an interior point of both segments.
We will call a common point T of two segments L1 and L2 a true
 intersection point of L1 and L2  if T is the only common point of L1
 and L2  and T is an interior point of both segments.

Consider the three segments L1, L2, and L3:
L1: (27, 44) to (12, 32)
L2: (46, 53) to (17, 62)
L3: (46, 70) to (22, 40)
It can be verified that line segments L2 and L3 have a true intersection
 point. We note that as the one of the end points of L3: (22,40) lies
 on L1 this is not considered to be a true point of intersection. L1 and
 L2 have no common point. So among the three line segments, we find one
 true intersection point.
Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate
 20000 numbers using the so-called "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number
 generator.
s0 = 290797
sn+1 = sn×sn (modulo 50515093)
tn = sn (modulo 500)
To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers tn. That is,
 the first line segment is given by:
(t1, t2) to (t3, t4)
The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should
 be: 27, 144, 12 and 232. The first segment would thus be (27,144) to
 (12,232).
How many distinct true intersection points are found among the 5000
 line segments?

Problem 166
A 4x4 grid is filled with digits d, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9.
It can be seen that in the grid

6 3 3 0
5 0 4 3
0 7 1 4
1 2 4 5
the sum of each row and each column has the value 12. Moreover the sum
 of each diagonal is also 12.
In how many ways can you fill a 4x4 grid with the digits d, 0 ≤ d ≤
 9 so that each row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum?

Problem 167
For two positive integers a and b, the Ulam sequence U(a,b) is defined
 by U(a,b)1 = a, U(a,b)2 = b and for k > 2,
U(a,b)k is the smallest integer greater than U(a,b)(k-1) which can be
 written in exactly one way as the sum of two distinct previous members
 of U(a,b).
For example, the sequence U(1,2) begins with
1, 2, 3 = 1 + 2, 4 = 1 + 3, 6 = 2 + 4, 8 = 2 + 6, 11 = 3 + 8;
5 does not belong to it because 5 = 1 + 4 = 2 + 3 has two representations
 as the sum of two previous members, likewise 7 = 1 + 6 = 3 + 4.
Find ∑ U(2,2n+1)k for 2 ≤ n ≤10, where k = 1011.

Problem 168
Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving
 the last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.
It can be verified that 714285=5×142857.
This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of
 its right-rotation.
Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 < n < 10100,
 that have this property.

Problem 169
Define f(0)=1 and f(n) to be the number of different ways n can be
 expressed as a sum of integer powers of 2 using each power no more
 than twice.
For example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express 10:
1 + 1 + 8
1 + 1 + 4 + 41 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4
2 + 4 + 4
2 + 8
What is f(1025)?

Problem 170
Take the number 6 and multiply it by each of 1273 and 9854:
6 × 1273 =  7638
6 × 9854 = 59124
By concatenating these products we get the 1 to 9 pandigital
 763859124. We will call 763859124 the "concatenated product of 6 and
 (1273,9854)". Notice too, that the concatenation of the input numbers,
 612739854, is also 1 to 9 pandigital.
The same can be done for 0 to 9 pandigital numbers.
What is the largest 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit concatenated product of
 an integer with two or more other integers, such that the concatenation
 of the input numbers is also a 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit number?

Problem 171
For a positive integer n, let f(n) be the sum of the squares of the digits
 (in base 10) of n, e.g.
f(3) = 32 = 9,
f(25) = 22 + 52 = 4 + 25 = 29,
f(442) = 42 + 42 + 22 = 16 + 16 + 4 = 36
Find the last nine digits of the sum of all n, 0 < n < 1020, such that
 f(n) is a perfect square.

Problem 172
How many 18-digit numbers n (without leading zeros) are there such that
 no digit occurs more than three times in n?

Problem 173
We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square
 "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For
 example, using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different
 square laminae:


With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at
 one time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.
Using up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can
 be formed?

Problem 174
We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square
 "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.
Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: 3x3
 square with a 1x1 hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles
 it is possible to form two distinct laminae.


If t represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that t = 8 is
 type L(1) and t = 32 is type L(2).
Let N(n) be the number of t ≤ 1000000 such that t is type L(n); for
 example, N(15) = 832.
What is ∑ N(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 10?

Problem 175
Define f(0)=1 and f(n) to be the number of ways to write n as a sum of
 powers of 2 where no power occurs more than twice.

For example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express
 10:10 = 8+2 = 8+1+1 = 4+4+2 = 4+2+2+1+1 = 4+4+1+1

It can be shown that for every fraction p/q (p>0, q>0) there exists at
 least one integer n such that f(n)/f(n-1)=p/q.
For instance, the smallest n for which f(n)/f(n-1)=13/17 is 241.
The binary expansion of 241 is 11110001.
Reading this binary number from the most significant bit to the least
 significant bit there are 4 one's, 3 zeroes and 1 one. We shall call
 the string 4,3,1 the Shortened Binary Expansion of 241.
Find the Shortened Binary Expansion of the smallest n for which
 f(n)/f(n-1)=123456789/987654321.

The four right-angled triangles with sides (9,12,15), (12,16,20),
 (5,12,13) and (12,35,37) all have one of the shorter sides (catheti)
 equal to 12. It can be shown that no other integer sided right-angled
 triangle exists with one of the catheti equal to 12.
Find the smallest integer that can be the length of a cathetus of exactly
 47547 different integer sided right-angled triangles.

Problem 177
Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral, with diagonals AC and BD. At each
 vertex the diagonal makes an angle with each of the two sides, creating
 eight corner angles.

For example, at vertex A, the two angles are CAD, CAB.
We call such a quadrilateral for which all eight corner angles
 have integer values when measured in degrees an "integer angled
 quadrilateral". An example of an integer angled quadrilateral is a
 square, where all eight corner angles are 45°. Another example is
 given by DAC = 20°, BAC = 60°, ABD = 50°, CBD = 30°, BCA = 40°,
 DCA = 30°, CDB = 80°, ADB = 50°.
What is the total number of non-similar integer angled quadrilaterals?
Note: In your calculations you may assume that a calculated angle is
 integral if it is within a tolerance of 10-9 of an integer value.

Problem 178
Consider the number 45656.
It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of 45656 has a
 difference of one.
A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a difference of
 one is called a step number.
A pandigital number  contains every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least
 once.

How many pandigital step numbers less than 1040 are there?


Problem 179
Find the number of integers 1 < n < 107, for which n and n + 1 have
 the same number of positive divisors. For example, 14 has the positive
 divisors 1, 2, 7, 14 while 15 has 1, 3, 5, 15.

Problem 180
For any integer n, consider the three functions
f1,n(x,y,z) = xn+1 + yn+1 − zn+1f2,n(x,y,z) = (xy + yz + zx)*(xn-1 +
 yn-1 − zn-1)f3,n(x,y,z) = xyz*(xn-2 + yn-2 − zn-2)
and their combination
fn(x,y,z) = f1,n(x,y,z) + f2,n(x,y,z) − f3,n(x,y,z)
We call (x,y,z) a golden triple of order k if x, y, and z are all rational
 numbers of the form a / b with
0 < a < b ≤ k and there is (at least) one integer n, so that fn(x,y,z)
 = 0.
Let s(x,y,z) = x + y + z.
Let t = u / v be the sum of all distinct s(x,y,z) for all golden triples
 (x,y,z) of order 35. All the s(x,y,z) and t  must be in reduced form.

Having three black objects B and one white object W they can be grouped
 in 7 ways like this:

(B,BB,W)(BBB,W)(BB,BW)
In how many ways can sixty black objects B and forty white objects W be
 thus grouped?

Problem 182
The RSA encryption is based on the following procedure:
Generate two distinct primes p and q.Compute n=pq and φ=(p-1)(q-1).
Find an integer e, 1<e<φ, such that gcd(e,φ)=1.
A message in this system is a number in the interval [0,n-1].
A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers
 in the interval [0,n-1]).
To encrypt the text,  for each message, m, c=me mod n is calculated.
To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate d such
 that ed=1 mod φ, then for each encrypted message, c, calculate m=cd
 mod n.
There exist values of e and m  such that me mod n=m.We call messages m
 for which me mod n=m unconcealed messages.
An issue when choosing e is that there should not be too many unconcealed
 messages.  For instance, let p=19 and q=37.
Then n=19*37=703 and φ=18*36=648.
If we choose e=181, then, although gcd(181,648)=1 it turns out that all
 possible messagesm (0≤m≤n-1) are unconcealed when calculating me
 mod n.
For any valid choice of e there exist some unconcealed messages.
It's important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum.
Choose p=1009 and q=3643.
Find the sum of all values of e, 1<e<φ(1009,3643) and gcd(e,φ)=1,
 so that the number of unconcealed messages for this value of e is at
 a minimum.

Problem 183
Let N be a positive integer and let N be split into k equal parts, r =
 N/k, so that N = r + r + ... + r.
Let P be the product of these parts, P = r × r × ... × r = rk.
For example, if 11 is split into five equal parts, 11 = 2.2 + 2.2 +
 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2, then P = 2.25 = 51.53632.
Let M(N) = Pmax for a given value of N.
It turns out that the maximum for N = 11 is found by splitting eleven
 into four equal parts which leads to Pmax = (11/4)4; that is, M(11) =
 14641/256 = 57.19140625, which is a terminating decimal.
However, for N = 8 the maximum is achieved by splitting it into three
 equal parts, so M(8) = 512/27, which is a non-terminating decimal.
Let D(N) = N if M(N) is a non-terminating decimal and D(N) = -N if M(N)
 is a terminating decimal.
For example, ∑ D(N) for 5 ≤ N ≤ 100 is 2438.
Find ∑ D(N) for 5 ≤ N ≤ 10000.

Problem 184
Consider the set Ir of points (x,y) with integer co-ordinates in the
 interior of the circle with radius r, centered at the origin, i.e. x2 +
 y2 < r2.
For a radius of 2, I2 contains the nine points (0,0), (1,0), (1,1),
 (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1) and (1,-1). There are eight
 triangles having all three vertices in I2 which contain the origin in
 the interior. Two of them are shown below, the others are obtained from
 these by rotation.

For a radius of 3, there are 360 triangles containing the origin in the
 interior and having all vertices in I3 and for I5 the number is 10600.
How many triangles are there containing the origin in the interior and
 having all three vertices in I105?

Problem 185
The game Number Mind is a variant of the well known game Master Mind.
Instead of coloured pegs, you have to guess a secret sequence of
 digits. After each guess you're only told in how many places you've
 guessed the correct digit. So, if the sequence was 1234 and you guessed
 2036, you'd be told that you have one correct digit; however, you would
 NOT be told that you also have another digit in the wrong place.
For instance, given the following guesses for a 5-digit secret sequence,

70794 ;0 correct
39458 ;2 correct

Here are the records from a busy telephone system with one million users:

RecNrCallerCalled120000710005326001835004393600863701497.........
The telephone number of the caller and the called number in record n are
 Caller(n) = S2n-1 and Called(n) = S2n where S1,2,3,... come from the
 "Lagged Fibonacci Generator":
For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, Sk = [100003 - 200003k + 300007k3] (modulo 1000000)
For 56 ≤ k, Sk = [Sk-24 + Sk-55] (modulo 1000000)
If Caller(n) = Called(n) then the user is assumed to have misdialled
 and the call fails; otherwise the call is successful.
From the start of the records, we say that any pair of users X and Y
 are friends if X calls Y or vice-versa. Similarly, X is a friend of
 a friend of Z if X is a friend of Y and Y is a friend of Z; and so on
 for longer chains.
The Prime Minister's phone number is 524287. After how many successful
 calls, not counting misdials, will 99% of the users (including the PM)
 be a friend, or a friend of a friend etc., of the Prime Minister?

A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. For
 example, 15 = 3 × 5; 9 = 3 × 3; 12 = 2 × 2 × 3.
There are ten composites below thirty containing precisely two, not
 necessarily distinct, prime factors:
4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26.
How many composite integers, n < 108, have precisely two, not necessarily

The hyperexponentiation or tetration of a number a by a positive integer
 b, denoted by a↑↑b or ba, is recursively defined by:
a↑↑1 = a,
a↑↑(k+1) = a(a↑↑k).

Thus we have e.g. 3↑↑2 = 33 = 27, hence 3↑↑3 = 327 = 7625597484987
 and 3↑↑4 is roughly 103.6383346400240996*10^12.
Find the last 8 digits of 1777↑↑1855.

Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:

We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours:
 red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same
 colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two triangles
 are said to be neighbouring if they share an edge.
Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.
For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:

 reflection is considered distinct from C unless the two are identical.
How many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?

A particular school offers cash rewards to children with good attendance
 and punctuality. If they are absent for three consecutive days or late
 on more than one occasion then they forfeit their prize.
During an n-day period a trinary string is formed for each child
 consisting of L's (late), O's (on time), and A's (absent).
Although there are eighty-one trinary strings for a 4-day period that

Problem 192
Let $x$ be a real number.
A best approximation to $x$ for the denominator bound $d$ is a rational
 number $\frac r s $  in reduced form, with $s \le d$, such that any
 rational number which is closer to $x$ than $\frac r s$ has a denominator
 larger than $d$: $|\frac p q -x | < |\frac r s -x| \Rightarrow q > d$

For example, the best approximation to $\sqrt {13}$ for the denominator
 bound 20 is $\frac {18} 5$ and the best approximation to $\sqrt {13}$
 for the denominator bound 30 is $\frac {101}{28}$.
Find the sum of all denominators of the best approximations to $\sqrt n$
 for the denominator bound $10^{12}$, where $n$ is not a perfect square
 and $ 1 < n \le 100000$.

Problem 193
A positive integer n is called squarefree, if no square of a prime divides
 n, thus 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 are squarefree, but not 4, 8, 9, 12.
How many squarefree numbers are there below 250?

Problem 194
Consider graphs built with the units A:
and B: , where the units are glued along
the vertical edges as in the graph .
A configuration of type (a,b,c) is a graph thus built of a units A and b
 units B, where the graph's vertices are coloured using up to c colours,
 so that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.
The compound graph above is an example of a configuration of type (2,2,6),
 in fact of type (2,2,c) for all c ≥ 4.
Let N(a,b,c) be the number of configurations of type (a,b,c).
For example, N(1,0,3) = 24, N(0,2,4) = 92928 and N(2,2,3) = 20736.
Find the last 8 digits of N(25,75,1984).

Problem 195
Let's call an integer sided triangle with exactly one angle of 60 degrees
 a 60-degree triangle.
Let r be the radius of the inscribed circle of such a 60-degree triangle.
There are 1234 60-degree triangles for which r ≤ 100.
Let T(n) be the number of 60-degree triangles for which r ≤ n, so T(100)
 = 1234,  T(1000) = 22767, and  T(10000) = 359912.
Find T(1053779).

Build a triangle from all positive integers in the following way:
 1
 2  3
 4  5  6

56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66
. . .
Each positive integer has up to eight neighbours in the triangle.
A set of three primes is called a prime triplet if one of the three
 primes has the other two as neighbours in the triangle.
For example, in the second row, the prime numbers 2 and 3 are elements
 of some prime triplet.
If row 8 is considered, it contains two primes which are elements of
 some prime triplet, i.e. 29 and 31.
If row 9 is considered, it contains only one prime which is an element
 of some prime triplet: 37.
Define S(n) as the sum of the primes in row n which are elements of any
 prime triplet.
Then S(8)=60 and S(9)=37.
You are given that S(10000)=950007619.
Find  S(5678027) + S(7208785).

Problem 197
Given is the function f(x) = ⌊230.403243784-x2⌋ × 10-9 ( ⌊ ⌋
 is the floor-function),
the sequence un is defined by u0 = -1 and un+1 = f(un).
Find un + un+1 for n = 1012.
Give your answer with 9 digits after the decimal point.

Problem 198
A best approximation to a real number $x$ for the denominator bound $d$
 is a rational number $\frac r s$ (in reduced form) with $s \le d$,
 so that any rational number $\frac p q$ which is closer to $x$ than
 $\frac r s$ has $q > d$.
Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for
 all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. $\frac
 9 {40}$ has the two best approximations $\frac 1 4$ and $\frac 1 5$
 for the denominator bound $6$.
We shall call a real number $x$ ambiguous, if there is at
 least one denominator bound for which $x$ possesses two best
 approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous number is necessarily rational.
How many ambiguous numbers $x=\frac p q, 0 < x < \frac 1 {100}$, are
 there whose denominator $q$ does not exceed $10^8$?

Problem 199
Three circles of equal radius are placed inside a larger circle such that
 each pair of circles is tangent to one another and the inner circles
 do not overlap. There are four uncovered "gaps" which are to be filled
 iteratively with more tangent circles.



At each iteration, a maximally sized circle is placed in each gap,
 which creates more gaps for the next iteration. After 3 iterations
 (pictured), there are 108 gaps and the fraction of the area which is
 not covered by circles is 0.06790342, rounded to eight decimal places.


What fraction of the area is not covered by circles after 10 iterations?
Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places using the format
 x.xxxxxxxx .

For example, 200 = 5223 or 120072949 = 232613.
The first five squbes are 72, 108, 200, 392, and 500.
Interestingly, 200 is also the first number for which you cannot
 change any single digit to make a prime; we shall call such numbers,
 prime-proof. The next prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous
 sub-string "200" is 1992008.
Find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string
 "200".

For any set A of numbers, let sum(A) be the sum of the elements of A.
Consider the set B = {1,3,6,8,10,11}. There are 20 subsets of B containing
 three elements, and their sums are:

sum({1,3,6}) = 10,
sum({1,3,8}) = 12,
sum({1,3,10}) = 14,
sum({1,3,11}) = 15,
sum({1,6,8}) = 15,

sum({3,8,10}) = 21,
sum({3,8,11}) = 22,
sum({3,10,11}) = 24,
sum({6,8,10}) = 24,
sum({6,8,11}) = 25,
sum({6,10,11}) = 27,
sum({8,10,11}) = 29.
Some of these sums occur more than once, others are unique.
For a set A, let U(A,k) be the set of unique sums of k-element subsets
 of A, in our example we find U(B,3) = {10,12,14,18,21,25,27,29} and
 sum(U(B,3)) = 156.
Now consider the 100-element set S = {12, 22, ... , 1002}.

Three mirrors are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, with
 their reflective surfaces pointing inwards. There is an infinitesimal
 gap at each vertex of the triangle through which a laser beam may pass.

A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor larger
 than 5.
So the first few Hamming numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15.
There are 1105 Hamming numbers not exceeding 108.

Hence the Hamming numbers are the generalised Hamming numbers of type 5.
How many generalised Hamming numbers of type 100 are there which don't
 exceed 109?

 }, consists of all points (X,Y,Z) such that x0 ≤ X ≤ x0+dx, y0
 ≤ Y ≤ y0+dy and z0 ≤ Z ≤ z0+dz.  The volume of the cuboid is
 the product, dx × dy × dz.  The combined volume of a collection of
 cuboids is the volume of their union and will be less than the sum of
 the individual volumes if any cuboids overlap.
Let C1,...,C50000 be a collection of 50000 axis-aligned cuboids such
 that Cn has parameters
x0 = S6n-5 modulo 10000y0 = S6n-4 modulo 10000z0 = S6n-3 modulo

Let φ be Euler's totient function, i.e. for a natural number n,
φ(n) is the number of k, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, for which gcd(k,n) = 1.
By iterating φ, each positive integer generates a decreasing chain of

Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2×1 and 3×1 bricks
 (horizontal×vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the
 gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive

For example, the following 9×3 wall is not acceptable due to the running
 crack shown in red:


There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9×3 wall, written W(9,3)

Problem 217

A positive integer with k (decimal) digits is called balanced if its first
 ⌈k/2⌉ digits sum to the same value as its last ⌈k/2⌉ digits,
 where ⌈x⌉, pronounced ceiling of x, is the smallest integer ≥ x,
 thus ⌈π⌉ = 4 and ⌈5⌉ = 5.
So, for example, all palindromes are balanced, as is 13722.
Let T(n) be the sum of all balanced numbers less than 10n.
Thus: T(1) = 45, T(2) = 540 and T(5) = 334795890.

Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.
The area of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect
 numbers 6 and 28.
Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and
 gcd(b,c)=1.
Also c is a perfect square.
We will call a right angled triangle perfect if
-it is a primitive right angled triangle
-its hypotenuse is a perfect square
We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if
-it is a perfect right angled triangle and
-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.

Problem 219
Let A and B be bit strings (sequences of 0's and 1's).
If A is equal to the leftmost length(A) bits of B, then A is said to be
 a prefix of B.
For example, 00110 is a prefix of 001101001, but not of 00111 or 100110.
A prefix-free code of size n is a collection of n distinct bit strings
 such that no string is a prefix of any other.  For example, this is a
 prefix-free code of size 6:
0000, 0001, 001, 01, 10, 11
Now suppose that it costs one penny to transmit a '0' bit, but four
 pence to transmit a '1'.
Then the total cost of the prefix-free code shown above is 35 pence,
 which happens to be the cheapest possible for the skewed pricing scheme
 in question.
In short, we write Cost(6) = 35.
What is Cost(109) ?

Problem 220
Let D0 be the two-letter string "Fa".  For n≥1, derive Dn from Dn-1
 by the string-rewriting rules:
"a" → "aRbFR"
"b" → "LFaLb"
Thus, D0 = "Fa", D1 = "FaRbFR", D2 = "FaRbFRRLFaLbFR", and so on.
These strings can be interpreted as instructions to a computer graphics
 program, with "F" meaning "draw forward one unit", "L" meaning "turn
 left 90 degrees", "R" meaning "turn right 90 degrees", and "a" and "b"
 being ignored.  The initial position of the computer cursor is (0,0),
 pointing up towards (0,1).
Then Dn is an exotic drawing known as the Heighway Dragon of order n.
 For example, D10 is shown below; counting each "F" as one step, the
 highlighted spot at (18,16) is the position reached after 500 steps.

 exist integers p, q, r such that:
$$A = p \cdot q \cdot r$$
and
$$\dfrac{1}{A} = \dfrac{1}{p} + \dfrac{1}{q} + \dfrac{1}{r}$$
For example, 630 is an Alexandrian integer ($p = 5, q = -7, r = -18$).
In fact, 630 is the 6th Alexandrian integer,  the first 6 Alexandrian
 integers being: 6, 42, 120, 156, 420, and 630.

Problem 227
The Chase is a game played with two dice and an even number of players.
The players sit around a table and the game begins with two opposite
 players having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die
 roll it.
If the player rolls 1, then the die passes to the neighbour on the left.
If the player rolls 6, then the die passes to the neighbour on the right.
Otherwise, the player keeps the die for the next turn.
The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled
 and passed; that player has then lost.

Problem 228
Let Sn be the regular n-sided polygon – or shape – whose vertices

vk (k = 1,2,…,n) have coordinates:

xk   =   cos( 2k-1/n ×180° )

yk   =   sin( 2k-1/n ×180° )
Each Sn is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points
        on the perimeter and in the interior.
The Minkowski sum, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of

adding every point in S to every point in T, where point addition is
        performed coordinate-wise:

(u, v) + (x, y) = (u+x, v+y).
For example, the sum of S3 and S4 is the six-sided shape shown in
        pink below:


How many sides does S1864 + S1865 + … + S1909 have?

Problem 229
Consider the number 3600. It is very special, because

3600 = 482 +     362
3600 = 202 + 2×402
3600 = 302 + 3×302
3600 = 452 + 7×152
Similarly, we find that 88201 = 992 + 2802 = 2872 + 2×542 = 2832 +
        3×522 = 1972 + 7×842.
In 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two

where the ak and bk are positive integers.
There are 75373 such numbers that do not exceed 107.

Problem 230
For any two strings of digits, A and B, we define FA,B to be the sequence
        (A,B,AB,BAB,ABBAB,...) in which each term is the concatenation
        of the previous two.
Further, we define DA,B(n) to be the nth digit in the first term of FA,B
        that contains at least n digits.
Example:
Let A=1415926535, B=8979323846. We wish to find DA,B(35), say.
The first few terms of FA,B are:
1415926535

14159265358979323846
897932384614159265358979323846
14159265358979323846897932384614159265358979323846
Then DA,B(35) is the 35th digit in the fifth term, which is 9.
Now we use for A the first 100 digits of π behind the decimal point:
14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510

The binomial coefficient $\displaystyle \binom {10} 3 = 120$.
$120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$,
        and $2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14$.
So the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of $\displaystyle
        \binom {10} 3$ is $14$.

Find the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of $\displaystyle

Problem 232
Two players share an unbiased coin and take it in turns to play The Race.
On Player 1's turn, the coin is tossed once. If it comes up Heads, then
        Player 1 scores one point; if it comes up Tails, then no points
        are scored.
On Player 2's turn, a positive integer, $T$, is chosen by Player 2 and
        the coin is tossed $T$ times. If it comes up all Heads, then
        Player 2 scores $2^{T-1}$ points; otherwise, no points are scored.
Player 1 goes first and the winner is the first to 100 or more points.
Player 2 will always selects the number, $T$, of coin tosses that

Problem 234
For an integer n ≥ 4, we define the lower prime square root of n,
        denoted by lps(n), as the largest prime ≤ √n and the upper
        prime square root of n, ups(n), as the smallest prime ≥ √n.
So, for example, lps(4) = 2 = ups(4), lps(1000) = 31, ups(1000) = 37.
Let us call an integer n ≥ 4 semidivisible, if one of lps(n) and ups(n)
        divides n, but not both.
The sum of the semidivisible numbers not exceeding 15 is 30, the numbers
        are 8, 10 and 12. 15 is not semidivisible because it is a multiple
        of both lps(15) = 3 and ups(15) = 5.
As a further example, the sum of the 92 semidivisible numbers up to 1000
        is 34825.

Problem 236
Suppliers 'A' and 'B' provided the following numbers of products for
        the luxury hamper market:
Product'A''B'Beluga Caviar5248640Christmas Cake13121888Gammon
        Joint26243776Vintage Port57603776Champagne Truffles39365664
Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect
        condition, there is inevitably some spoilage - i.e. products
        gone bad.
The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:The
        five per-product spoilage rates for each supplier are equal to
        the number of products gone bad divided by the number of products
        supplied, for each of the five products in turn.
The overall spoilage rate for each supplier is equal to the total number
        of products gone bad divided by the total number of products
        provided by that supplier.To their surprise, the suppliers
        found that each of the five per-product spoilage rates was
        worse (higher) for 'B' than for 'A' by the same factor (ratio of
        spoilage rates), m>1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall spoilage

Problem 237
Let T(n) be the number of tours over a 4 × n playing board such that:
The tour starts in the top left corner.
The tour consists of moves that are up, down, left, or right one square.
The tour visits each square exactly once.
The tour ends in the bottom left corner.

Problem 238
Create a sequence of numbers using the "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random
        number generator:
s0
=
14025256
sn+1
=
sn2 mod 20300713

Concatenate these numbers  s0s1s2… to create a string w of infinite
        length.
Then, w = 14025256741014958470038053646…
For a positive integer k, if no substring of w exists with a sum of
        digits equal to k, p(k) is defined to be zero. If at least one
        substring of w exists with a sum of digits equal to k, we define
        p(k) = z, where z is the starting position of the earliest
        such substring.
For instance:
The substrings 1, 14, 1402, …
with respective sums of digits equal to 1, 5, 7, …
start at position 1, hence p(1) = p(5) = p(7) = … = 1.
The substrings 4, 402, 4025, …
with respective sums of digits equal to 4, 6, 11, …
start at position 2, hence p(4) = p(6) = p(11) = … = 2.
The substrings 02, 0252, …
with respective sums of digits equal to 2, 9, …
start at position 3, hence p(2) = p(9) = … = 3.
Note that substring 025 starting at position 3, has a sum of digits equal
        to 7, but there was an earlier substring (starting at position 1)
        with a sum of digits equal to 7, so p(7) = 1, not 3.
We can verify that, for 0 < k ≤ 103, ∑ p(k) = 4742.
Find ∑ p(k), for 0 < k ≤ 2×1015.

Problem 240
There are 1111 ways in which five 6-sided dice (sides numbered 1 to 6)

D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 4,3,3,5,6

D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 6,6,3,3,3

In how many ways can twenty 12-sided dice (sides numbered 1 to 12)
        be rolled so that the top ten sum to 70?

Problem 241
For a positive integer $n$, let $\sigma(n)$ be the sum of all divisors
        of $n$. For example, $\sigma(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12$.
A perfect number, as you probably know, is a number with $\sigma(n) = 2n$.
Let us define the perfection quotient of a positive integer as $p(n)
        = \dfrac{\sigma(n)}{n}$.
Find the sum of all positive integers $n \le 10^{18}$ for which $p(n)$
        has the form $k + \dfrac{1}{2}$, where $k$ is an integer.

Problem 242
Given the set {1,2,...,n}, we define f(n,k) as the number of its k-element
        subsets with an odd sum of elements. For example, f(5,3) = 4,
        since the set {1,2,3,4,5} has four 3-element subsets having an
        odd sum of elements, i.e.: {1,2,4}, {1,3,5}, {2,3,4} and {2,4,5}.
When all three values n, k and f(n,k) are odd, we say that they make
an odd-triplet [n,k,f(n,k)].
There are exactly five odd-triplets with n ≤ 10, namely:
[1,1,f(1,1) = 1], [5,1,f(5,1) = 3], [5,5,f(5,5) = 1],
        [9,1,f(9,1) = 5] and [9,9,f(9,9) = 1].
How many odd-triplets are there with n ≤ 1012 ?

Problem 243

A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is
        called a proper fraction.
For any denominator, d, there will be d−1 proper fractions; for example,
        with d = 12:1/12 , 2/12 , 3/12 , 4/12 , 5/12 , 6/12 , 7/12 ,
        8/12 , 9/12 , 10/12 , 11/12 .

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient
        fraction.
Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d),
        to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient;
        for example, R(12) = 4/11 .
In fact, d = 12 is the smallest denominator having a resilience R(d)
        < 4/10 .
Find the smallest denominator d, having a resilience R(d) < 15499/94744 .

Problem 244
You probably know the game Fifteen Puzzle. Here, instead of numbered
        tiles, we have seven red tiles and eight blue tiles.
A move is denoted by the uppercase initial of the direction (Left,
        Right, Up, Down) in which the tile is slid, e.g. starting
        from configuration (S), by the sequence LULUR we reach the
        configuration (E):

(S), (E)

For each path, its checksum is calculated by (pseudocode):

checksum = 0
checksum = (checksum × 243 + m1) mod 100 000 007
checksum = (checksum × 243 + m2) mod 100 000 007
   …
checksum = (checksum × 243 + mn) mod 100 000 007
where mk is the ASCII value of the kth letter in the move sequence and
        the ASCII values for the moves are:


L76R82U85D68
For the sequence LULUR given above, the checksum would be 19761398.
Now, starting from configuration (S),
find all shortest ways to reach configuration (T).

(S), (T)

What is the sum of all checksums for the paths having the minimal length?

Problem 245
We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient
        fraction. Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a
        denominator, $R(d)$, to be the ratio of its proper fractions
        that are resilient; for example, $R(12) = \dfrac{4}{11}$.
The resilience of a number $d \gt 1$ is then $\dfrac{\varphi(d)}{d -
        1}$, where $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function.
We further define the coresilience of a number $n \gt 1$ as $C(n) =
        \dfrac{n - \varphi(n)}{n - 1}$.
The coresilience of a prime $p$ is $C(p) = \dfrac{1}{p - 1}$.
Find the sum of all composite integers $1 \lt n \le 2 \times 10^{11}$,
        for which $C(n)$ is a unit fraction.

A definition for an ellipse is:
Given a circle c with centre M and radius r and a point G such that
        d(G,M)<r, the locus of the points that are equidistant from c
        and G form an ellipse.

The construction of the points of the ellipse is shown below.




Given are the points M(-2000,1500) and G(8000,1500).
Given is also the circle c with centre M and radius 15000.

From a point P outside e the two tangents t1 and t2 to the ellipse
        are drawn.
Let the points where t1 and t2 touch the ellipse be R and S.

Problem 247
Consider the region constrained by 1 ≤ x and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1/x.

Let S1 be the largest square that can fit under the curve.
Let S2 be the largest square that fits in the remaining area, and so on.

        squares to the left of Sn and the number of squares below Sn.




The diagram shows some such squares labelled by number.
S2 has one square to its left and none below, so the index of S2 is (1,0).
It can be seen that the index of S32 is (1,1) as is the index of S50.
50 is the largest n for which the index of Sn is (1,1).


What is the largest n for which the index of Sn is (3,3)?

A triplet of positive integers (a,b,c) is called a Cardano Triplet if
        it satisfies the condition:

Problem 252

Given a set of points on a plane, we define a convex hole to be a convex
        polygon having as vertices any of the given points and not
        containing any of the given points in its interior (in addition
        to the vertices, other given points may lie on the perimeter of
        the polygon).


As an example, the image below shows a set of twenty points and a few
        such convex holes.
The convex hole shown as a red heptagon has an area equal to 1049694.5
        square units, which is the highest possible area for a convex
        hole on the given set of points.




For our example, we used the first 20 points (T2k−1, T2k), for
        k = 1,2,…,20, produced with the pseudo-random number
        generator:
S0
=

What is the maximum area for a convex hole on the set containing the
        first 500 points in the pseudo-random sequence? Specify your
        answer including one digit after the decimal point.


Problem 253
A small child has a “number caterpillar” consisting of forty jigsaw
        pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together
        in a line, reveal the numbers 1 to 40 in order.
Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the
        caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He
        picks up the pieces at random and places them in the correct
        order. As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms
        distinct segments that gradually merge together. The number of
        segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases
        up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before
        finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).
For example:

Piece Placed
Segments So Far
121422936434554354……
Let M be the maximum number of segments encountered during a random
        tidy-up of the caterpillar.
For a caterpillar of ten pieces, the number of possibilities for each M is

M
Possibilities
1512      2250912      31815264      41418112    
         5144000      
so the most likely value of M is 3 and the average value is
        385643⁄113400 = 3.400732, rounded to six decimal places.
The most likely value of M for a forty-piece caterpillar is 11; but what
        is the average value of M?
Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.

Problem 254
Define f(n) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of n. For example,
        f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.
Define sf(n) as the sum of the digits of f(n). So sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.
Define g(i) to be the smallest positive integer n such that sf(n) =
        i. Though sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified
        that g(5) is 25.
Define sg(i) as the sum of the digits of g(i). So sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.
Further, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and ∑ sg(i) for 1 ≤
        i ≤ 20 is 156.
What is ∑ sg(i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ 150?

Problem 255
We define the rounded-square-root of a positive integer n as the square
        root of n rounded to the nearest integer.
The following procedure (essentially Heron's method adapted to integer
        arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of n:
Let d be the number of digits of the number n.
If d is odd, set $x_0 = 2 \times 10^{(d-1)/2}$.
If d is even, set $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(d-2)/2}$.
Repeat:
$$x_{k+1} = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{x_k + \lceil{n /
        x_k}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor$$

until $x_{k+1} = x_k$.
As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of n = 4321.n has 4
        digits, so $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(4-2)/2} = 70$.
$$x_1 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{70 + \lceil{4321 /
        70}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$
$$x_2 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{66 + \lceil{4321 /
        66}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$

Since $x_2 = x_1$, we stop here.
So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root
        of 4321 is 66 (the actual square root is 65.7343137…).

The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly
        low.
For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a 5-digit integer
        (10,000 ≤ n ≤ 99,999) with an average of 3.2102888889
        iterations (the average value was rounded to 10 decimal places).

Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of
        iterations required to find the rounded-square-root of a 14-digit
        number (1013 ≤ n < 1014)?
Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.

Note: The symbols $\lfloor x \rfloor$ and $\lceil x \rceil$ represent
        the floor function and ceiling function respectively.


Problem 256

Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room,
        without overlap.
Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1×2,
        there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of
        the rooms that can be covered.
For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer
        dimensions a, b and even size s = a·b.
We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and
        — without loss of generality — we add the condition a ≤ b.
There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no
        points where corners of four different mats meet.
For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4×4 room:


The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right
        is not: a red "X" in the middle, marks the point where four
        tatami meet.
Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with
        tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.
Further, we define T(s) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size s.
The smallest tatami-free room has size s = 70 and dimensions 7×10.
All the other rooms of size s = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are:
        1×70, 2×35 and 5×14.
Hence, T(70) = 1.
Similarly, we can verify that T(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5
        tatami-free rooms of size s = 1320:
20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and 33×40.
In fact, s = 1320 is the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 5.
Find the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 200.

Problem 257

Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with sides a ≤ b ≤ c.
(AB = c, BC = a and AC = b).
The angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the sides at points E,
        F and G (see picture below).




The segments EF, EG and FG partition the triangle ABC into four smaller
        triangles: AEG, BFE, CGF and EFG.
It can be proven that for each of these four triangles the ratio
        area(ABC)/area(subtriangle) is rational.
However, there exist triangles for which some or all of these ratios
        are integral.


How many triangles ABC with perimeter≤100,000,000 exist so that the
        ratio area(ABC)/area(AEG) is integral?


Problem 258
A sequence is defined as:

Problem 259
A positive integer will be called reachable if it can result from an
        arithmetic expression obeying the following rules:
Uses the digits 1 through 9, in that order and exactly once each.
Any successive digits can be concatenated (for example, using the digits
        2, 3 and 4 we obtain the number 234).
Only the four usual binary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
        multiplication and division) are allowed.
Each operation can be used any number of times, or not at all.
Unary minus is not allowed.
Any number of (possibly nested) parentheses may be used to define the
        order of operations.
For example, 42 is reachable, since (1/23) * ((4*5)-6) * (78-9) = 42.
What is the sum of all positive reachable integers?

Problem 260
A game is played with three piles of stones and two players.
On each player's turn, the player may remove one or more stones from
        the piles. However, if the player takes stones from more than
        one pile, then the same number of stones must be removed from
        each of the selected piles.
In other words, the player chooses some $N \gt 0$ and removes:
$N$ stones from any single pile; or
$N$ stones from each of any two piles ($2N$ total); or
$N$ stones from each of the three piles ($3N$ total).
The player taking the last stone(s) wins the game.
A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win.
For example, $(0,0,13)$, $(0,11,11)$, and $(5,5,5)$ are winning
        configurations because the first player can immediately remove
        all stones.
A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win,
        no matter what the first player does.
For example, $(0,1,2)$ and $(1,3,3)$ are losing configurations: any
        legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.
Consider all losing configurations $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ where $x_i \le y_i
        \le z_i \le 100$.
We can verify that $\sum (x_i + y_i + z_i) = 173895$ for these.
Find $\sum (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ where $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ ranges over the
        losing configurations with $x_i \le y_i \le z_i \le 1000$.

Problem 261
Let us call a positive integer k a square-pivot, if there is a pair
        of integers m > 0 and n ≥ k, such that the sum of the (m+1)
        consecutive squares up to k equals the sum of the m consecutive
        squares from (n+1) on:

(k-m)2 + ... + k2 = (n+1)2 + ... + (n+m)2.
Some small square-pivots are
4: 32 + 42 = 52
21: 202 + 212 = 292
24: 212 + 222 + 232 + 242 = 252 + 262 + 272
110: 1082 + 1092 + 1102 = 1332 + 1342Find the sum of all distinct
 square-pivots ≤ 1010.

Problem 262
The following equation represents the continuous topography of a
 mountainous region, giving the elevation h at any point (x,y):


A mosquito intends to fly from A(200,200) to B(1400,1400), without
 leaving the area given by 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1600.
Because of the intervening mountains, it first rises straight up to a
 point A', having elevation f. Then, while remaining at the same elevation
 f, it flies around any obstacles until it arrives at a point B' directly
 above B.
First, determine fmin which is the minimum constant elevation allowing
 such a trip from A to B, while remaining in the specified area.
Then, find the length of the shortest path between A' and B', while
 flying at that constant elevation fmin.
Give that length as your answer, rounded to three decimal places.
Note: For convenience, the elevation function shown above is repeated
 below, in a form suitable for most programming languages:
h=( 5000-0.005*(x*x+y*y+x*y)+12.5*(x+y) ) * exp(
 -abs(0.000001*(x*x+y*y)-0.0015*(x+y)+0.7) )

Problem 263

Consider the number 6. The divisors of 6 are: 1,2,3 and 6.
Every number from 1 up to and including 6 can be written as a sum of
 distinct divisors of 6:
1=1, 2=2, 3=1+2, 4=1+3, 5=2+3, 6=6.
A number n is called a practical number if every number from 1 up to
 and including n can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of n.


A pair of consecutive prime numbers with a difference of six is called
 a sexy pair (since "sex" is the Latin word for "six"). The first sexy
 pair is (23, 29).


We may occasionally find a triple-pair, which means three consecutive
 sexy prime pairs, such that the second member of each pair is the first
 member of the next pair.


We shall call a number n such that :
(n-9, n-3), (n-3,n+3), (n+3, n+9) form a triple-pair, and
the numbers n-8, n-4, n, n+4 and n+8 are all practical,

Enter as your answer the sum of their perimeters rounded to four decimal
 places.

2N binary digits can be placed in a circle so that all the N-digit
 clockwise subsequences are distinct.
For N=3, two such circular arrangements are possible, ignoring rotations:

For the first arrangement, the 3-digit subsequences, in clockwise order,
 are: 000, 001, 010, 101, 011, 111, 110 and 100.
Each circular arrangement can be encoded as a number by concatenating
 the binary digits starting with the subsequence of all zeros as the
 most significant bits and proceeding clockwise. The two arrangements
 for N=3 are thus represented as 23 and 29:
00010111 2 = 23
00011101 2 = 29
Calling S(N) the sum of the unique numeric representations, we can see
 that S(3) = 23 + 29 = 52.
Find S(5).

Problem 266

The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.

 the square root of n the pseudo square root (PSR) of n.
It can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.

Problem 267
You are given a unique investment opportunity.
Starting with £1 of capital, you can choose a fixed proportion, f,
 of your capital to bet on a fair coin toss repeatedly for 1000 tosses.
Your return is double your bet for heads and you lose your bet for tails.
For example, if f = 1/4,  for the first toss you bet £0.25, and
 if heads comes up you win £0.5 and so then have £1.5. You then bet
 £0.375 and if the second toss is tails, you have £1.125.
Choosing f to maximize your chances of having at least £1,000,000,000
 after 1,000 flips, what is the chance that you become a billionaire?

Problem 269
A root or zero of a polynomial P(x) is a solution to the equation P(x)
 = 0.
Define Pn as the polynomial whose coefficients are the digits of n.
For example, P5703(x) = 5x3 + 7x2 + 3.
We can see that:Pn(0) is the last digit of n,
Pn(1) is the sum of the digits of n,
Pn(10) is n itself.Define Z(k) as the number of positive integers, n, not

Problem 270
A square piece of paper with integer dimensions N×N is placed with a
 corner at the origin and two of its sides along the x- and y-axes. Then,
 we cut it up respecting the following rules:
We only make straight cuts between two points lying on different sides
 of the square, and having integer coordinates.
Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border point.
Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.
Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the
 number of ways to cut an N×N square. For example, C(1) = 2 and
 C(2) = 30 (shown below).

What is C(30) mod 108 ?

Problem 271

For a positive number n, define S(n) as the sum of the integers x,
 for which 1<x<n andx3≡1 mod n.


When n=91, there are 8 possible values for x, namely : 9, 16, 22, 29,
 53, 74, 79, 81.
Thus, S(91)=9+16+22+29+53+74+79+81=363.

For N=65 there are two solutions:
a=1, b=8 and a=4, b=7.
We call S(N) the sum of the values of a of all solutions of a2 + b2 =
 N, 0 ≤ a ≤ b, a, b and N integer.
Thus S(65) = 1 + 4 = 5.
Find ∑ S(N), for all squarefree N only divisible by primes of the

Problem 274
For each integer p > 1 coprime to 10 there is a positive divisibility
 multiplier m < p which preserves divisibility by p for the following
 function on any positive integer, n:
f(n) = (all but the last digit of n) + (the last digit of n) * m
That is, if m is the divisibility multiplier for p, then f(n) is divisible
 by p if and only if n is divisible by p.
(When n is much larger than p, f(n) will be less than n and repeated
 application of f provides a multiplicative divisibility test for p.)
For example, the divisibility multiplier for 113 is 34.
f(76275) = 7627 + 5 * 34 = 7797 : 76275 and 7797 are both divisible
 by 113f(12345) = 1234 + 5 * 34 = 1404 : 12345 and 1404 are both not
 divisible by 113

Problem 275
Let us define a balanced sculpture of order n as follows:
A polyomino made up of n+1 tiles known as the blocks (n tiles) and the
 plinth (remaining tile);
the plinth has its centre at position (x = 0, y = 0);
the blocks have y-coordinates greater than zero (so the plinth is the
 unique lowest tile);
the centre of mass of all the blocks, combined, has x-coordinate equal
 to zero.
When counting the sculptures, any arrangements which are simply
 reflections about the y-axis, are not counted as distinct. For example,
 the 18 balanced sculptures of order 6 are shown below; note that each
 pair of mirror images (about the y-axis) is counted as one sculpture:

There are 964 balanced sculptures of order 10 and 360505 of order 15.How
 many balanced sculptures are there of order 18?

Problem 277

A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting
 value $a_1$ in the following way:

$a_{n+1} = \, \,\, \frac {a_n} 3 \quad$ if $a_n$ is divisible by $3$. We
 shall denote this as a large downward step, "D".

$a_{n+1} = \frac {4 a_n+2} 3 \, \,$ if $a_n$ divided by $3$ gives a
 remainder of $1$. We shall denote this as an upward step, "U".


$a_{n+1} = \frac {2 a_n -1} 3 \, \,$ if $a_n$ divided by $3$ gives a
 remainder of $2$. We shall denote this as a small downward step, "d".


The sequence terminates when some $a_n = 1$.


Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.
For instance if $a_1=231$, then the sequence
 $\{a_n\}=\{231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1\}$ corresponds to the steps
 "DdDddUUdDD".


Of course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence
 "DdDddUUdDD....".
For instance, if $a_1=1004064$, then the sequence is
 DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD.
In fact, $1004064$ is the smallest possible $a_1 > 10^6$ that begins
 with the sequence DdDddUUdDD.


What is the smallest $a_1 > 10^{15}$ that begins with the sequence
 "UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd"?


Problem 278

Given the values of integers $1 < a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n$, consider
 the linear combination
$q_1 a_1+q_2 a_2 + \dots + q_n a_n=b$, using only integer values $q_k
 \ge 0$.


Note that for a given set of $a_k$, it may be that not all values of $b$
 are possible.
For instance, if $a_1=5$ and $a_2=7$, there are no $q_1 \ge 0$ and $q_2
 \ge 0$ such that $b$ could be
$1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18$ or $23$.

In fact, $23$ is the largest impossible value of $b$ for $a_1=5$ and
 $a_2=7$. We therefore call $f(5, 7) = 23$. Similarly, it can be shown
 that $f(6, 10, 15)=29$ and $f(14, 22, 77) = 195$.


Find $\displaystyle \sum f( p\, q,p \, r, q \, r)$, where $p$, $q$
 and $r$ are prime numbers and $p < q < r < 5000$.

Problem 280
A laborious ant walks randomly on a 5x5 grid. The walk starts from the
 central square. At each step, the ant moves to an adjacent square at
 random, without leaving the grid; thus there are 2, 3 or 4 possible
 moves at each step depending on the ant's position.
At the start of the walk, a seed is placed on each square of the lower
 row. When the ant isn't carrying a seed and reaches a square of the
 lower row containing a seed, it will start to carry the seed. The
 ant will drop the seed on the first empty square of the upper row it
 eventually reaches.
What's the expected number of steps until all seeds have been dropped
 in the top row?

 with m different toppings (m ≥ 2), using each topping on exactly
 n slices (n ≥ 1). Reflections are considered distinct, rotations
 are not.
Thus, for instance, f(2,1) = 1, f(2,2) = f(3,1) = 2 and
 f(3,2) = 16. f(3,2) is shown below:

Find the sum of all f(m,n) such that f(m,n) ≤ 1015.

 perimeter and the area are both equal to 24.
So the area/perimeter ratio is equal to 1.
Consider also the triangle with sides 13, 14 and 15. The perimeter equals
 42 while the area is equal to 84.
So for this triangle the area/perimeter ratio is equal to 2.

Problem 284
The 3-digit number 376 in the decimal numbering system is an example
 of numbers with the special property that its square ends with the
 same digits: 3762 = 141376. Let's call a number with this property a
 steady square.
Steady squares can also be observed in other numbering systems. In
 the base 14 numbering system, the 3-digit number c37 is also a steady
 square: c372 = aa0c37, and the sum of its digits is c+3+7=18 in the same
 numbering system. The letters a, b, c and d are used for the 10, 11,
 12 and 13 digits respectively, in a manner similar to the hexadecimal
 numbering system.
For 1 ≤ n ≤ 9, the sum of the digits of all the n-digit steady
 squares in the base 14 numbering system is 2d8 (582 decimal). Steady
 squares with leading 0's are not allowed.
Find the sum of the digits of all the n-digit steady squares in the base
 14 numbering system for
1 ≤ n ≤ 10000 (decimal) and give your answer in the base 14 system
 using lower case letters where necessary.

Problem 285
Albert chooses a positive integer k, then two real numbers a, b are
 randomly chosen in the interval [0,1] with uniform distribution.
The square root of the sum (k·a+1)2 + (k·b+1)2 is then computed
 and rounded to the nearest integer. If the result is equal to k, he
 scores k points; otherwise he scores nothing.
For example, if k = 6, a = 0.2 and b = 0.85, then
 (k·a+1)2 + (k·b+1)2 = 42.05.
The square root of 42.05 is 6.484... and when rounded to the nearest
 integer, it becomes 6.
This is equal to k, so he scores 6 points.
It can be shown that if he plays 10 turns with k = 1, k = 2,
 ..., k = 10, the expected value of his total score, rounded to five
 decimal places, is 10.20914.
If he plays 105 turns with k = 1, k = 2, k = 3, ...,
 k = 105, what is the expected value of his total score, rounded to
 five decimal places?

 x = 2, ..., x = 50 and, according to her records, she has
 precisely a 2 % chance to score a total of exactly 20 points.
Find q and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.

Problem 287
The quadtree encoding allows us to describe a 2N×2N  black and white
 image as a sequence of bits (0 and 1). Those sequences are to be read
 from left to right like this:
the first bit deals with the complete 2N×2N region;
"0" denotes a split:
the current 2n×2n region is divided into 4 sub-regions of dimension
 2n-1×2n-1,
the next bits contains the description of the top left, top right,
 bottom left and bottom right sub-regions - in that order;
"10" indicates that the current region contains only black pixels;
"11" indicates that the current region contains only white pixels.Consider
 the following 4×4 image (colored marks denote places where a split
 can occur):

This image can be described by several sequences, for example :

"0100101111101110", of length 16, which is the minimal sequence for
 this image.
For a positive integer N, define DN as the 2N×2N image with the following
 coloring scheme:
the pixel with coordinates x = 0, y = 0 corresponds to the bottom
 left pixel,
if (x - 2N-1)2 + (y - 2N-1)2 ≤ 22N-2 then the pixel
 is black,
otherwise the pixel is white.What is the length of the minimal sequence

 consists of the m·n circles:
{ C(x,y): 0 ≤ x < m, 0 ≤ y < n, x and y are integers }
An Eulerian cycle on E(m,n) is a closed path that passes through each
 arc exactly once.
Many such paths are possible on E(m,n), but we are only interested in
 those which are not self-crossing:

 crosses itself.

 path.

Problem 293

An even positive integer N will be called admissible, if it is a power
 of 2 or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes.
The first twelve admissible numbers are 2,4,6,8,12,16,18,24,30,32,36,48.


If N is admissible, the smallest integer M > 1 such that N+M is prime,
 will be called the pseudo-Fortunate number for N.


For example, N=630 is admissible since it is even and its distinct prime
 factors are the consecutive primes 2,3,5 and 7.
The next prime number after 631 is 641; hence, the pseudo-Fortunate
 number for 630 is M=11.
It can also be seen that the pseudo-Fortunate number for 16 is 3.

C2: (x-12)2+(y-4)2=65


The circles C0, C1 and C2 are drawn in the picture below.


C0 and C1 form a lenticular hole, as well as C0 and C2.

We call an ordered pair of positive real numbers (r1, r2) a lenticular
 pair if there exist two circles with radii r1 and r2 that form a
 lenticular hole.

 previous two terms.
Starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,
 21, 34, 55, 89.
Every positive integer can be uniquely written as a sum of nonconsecutive
 terms of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, 100 = 3 + 8 + 89.
Such a sum is called the Zeckendorf representation of the number.
For any integer n>0, let z(n) be the number of terms in the Zeckendorf
 representation of n.
Thus, z(5) = 1, z(14) = 2, z(100) = 3 etc.
Also, for 0<n<106, ∑ z(n) = 7894453.

Larry and Robin play a memory game involving a sequence of random numbers
 between 1 and 10, inclusive, that are called out one at a time. Each
 player can remember up to 5 previous numbers. When the called number
 is in a player's memory, that player is awarded a point. If it's not,
 the player adds the called number to his memory, removing another number
 if his memory is full.
Both players start with empty memories. Both players always add new missed
 numbers to their memory but use a different strategy in deciding which
 number to remove:

 longest time.
Robin's strategy is to remove the number that's been in the memory the

Problem 299
Four points with integer coordinates are selected:A(a, 0), B(b, 0),
 C(0, c) and D(0, d),
with 0 < a < b and 0 < c < d.
Point P, also with integer coordinates, is chosen on the line AC so that
 the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP are all similar.

It is easy to prove that the three triangles can be similar, only if a=c.
So, given that a=c, we are looking for triplets (a,b,d) such that at
 least one point P (with integer coordinates) exists on AC, making the
 three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP all similar.
For example, if (a,b,d)=(2,3,4), it can be easily verified that point
 P(1,1) satisfies the above condition.
Note that the triplets (2,3,4) and (2,4,3) are considered as distinct,
 although point P(1,1) is common for both.
If b+d < 100, there are 92 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point
 P exists.
If b+d < 100 000, there are 320471 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that
 point P exists.
If b+d < 100 000 000, how many distinct triplets (a,b,d) are there
 such that point P exists?

Problem 300
In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting
 of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH.
For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP
 is considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are 2n distinct proteins
 consisting of n elements.
When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in
 such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible,
 since this is energetically advantageous.
As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with
 the P-elements on the outside.
Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will
 only consider protein folding in two dimensions.
The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could
 be folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).

The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would
 never occur naturally.
On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points,
 which is optimal for this string.
Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any

Problem 301
Nim is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players take it in
 turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no stones remain.
We'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works
 as follows:
At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.
On each player's turn, the player may remove any positive number of
 stones from any single heap.
The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.
If $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size
 $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$, then there is a simple function, which you may
 look up or attempt to deduce for yourself, $X(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ that returns:
zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually
 lose; or
non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will
 eventually win.
For example $X(1,2,3) = 0$ because, no matter what the current player
 does, the opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of
 equal size, at which point every move by the current player can be
 mirrored by the opponent until no stones remain; so the current player
 loses. To illustrate:
current player moves to $(1,2,1)$
opponent moves to $(1,0,1)$
current player moves to $(0,0,1)$
opponent moves to $(0,0,0)$, and so wins.
For how many positive integers $n \le 2^{30}$ does $X(n,2n,3n) = 0$ ?

Problem 302

A positive integer n is powerful if p2 is a divisor of n for every prime
 factor p in n.


A positive integer n is a perfect power if n can be expressed as a power
 of another positive integer.


A positive integer n is an Achilles number if n is powerful but not a
 perfect power. For example, 864 and 1800 are Achilles numbers: 864 =
 25·33 and 1800 = 23·32·52.


We shall call a positive integer S a Strong Achilles number if both S
 and φ(S) are Achilles numbers.1
For example, 864 is a Strong Achilles number: φ(864) = 288 =
 25·32. However, 1800 isn't a Strong Achilles number because: φ(1800)
 = 480 = 25·31·51.

There are 7 Strong Achilles numbers below 104 and 656 below 108.


How many Strong Achilles numbers are there below 1018?


1 φ denotes Euler's totient function.


Problem 303

For a positive integer n, define f(n) as the least positive multiple of
 n that, written in base 10, uses only digits ≤ 2.
Thus f(2)=2, f(3)=12, f(7)=21, f(42)=210, f(89)=1121222.
Also, $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{100} {\dfrac{f(n)}{n}} = 11363107$.

Find $\sum \limits_{n=1}^{10000} {\dfrac{f(n)}{n}}$.


Problem 304

For any positive integer n the function next_prime(n) returns the smallest
 prime p  such that p>n.


The sequence a(n) is defined by:
a(1)=next_prime(1014) and a(n)=next_prime(a(n-1)) for n>1.


The fibonacci sequence f(n) is defined by:
f(0)=0, f(1)=1 and f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) for n>1.


The sequence b(n) is defined as f(a(n)).

Problem 305

Let's call S the (infinite) string that is made by concatenating the
 consecutive positive integers (starting from 1)  written down in base 10.
Thus, S = 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242...


It's easy to see that any number will show up an infinite number of
 times in S.


Let's call f(n) the starting position of the nth occurrence of n in S.
For example, f(1)=1, f(5)=81, f(12)=271 and f(7780)=111111365.


Find ∑ f(3k) for 1≤k≤13.


Problem 306
The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:
Two players start with a strip of $n$ white squares and they take
 alternate turns.
On each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints
 them black.
The first player who cannot make a move loses.
$n = 1$: No valid moves, so the first player loses automatically.
$n = 2$: Only one valid move, after which the second player loses.
$n = 3$: Two valid moves, but both leave a situation where the second
 player loses.
$n = 4$: Three valid moves for the first player, who is able to win the
 game by painting the two middle squares.
$n = 5$: Four valid moves for the first player (shown below in red),
 but no matter what the player does, the second player (blue) wins.

So, for $1 \le n \le 5$, there are 3 values of $n$ for which the first
 player can force a win.
Similarly, for $1 \le n \le 50$, there are 40 values of $n$ for which
 the first player can force a win.
For $1 \le n \le 1 000 000$, how many values of $n$ are there for which
 the first player can force a win?

Problem 307

k defects are randomly distributed amongst n integrated-circuit chips
 produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip
 and each defect is independent of the other defects).


Let p(k,n) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least
 3 defects.
For instance p(3,7) ≈ 0.0204081633.


Find p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal

Problem 308
A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a
 list of fractions.
The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer,
 which is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran
 program multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in the list
 which will leave it an integer.
For example, one of the Fractran programs that John Horton Conway wrote
 for prime-generation consists of the following 14 fractions:
$$\dfrac{17}{91}, \dfrac{78}{85}, \dfrac{19}{51}, \dfrac{23}{38},
 \dfrac{29}{33}, \dfrac{77}{29}, \dfrac{95}{23}, \dfrac{77}{19},
 \dfrac{1}{17}, \dfrac{11}{13}, \dfrac{13}{11}, \dfrac{15}{2},
 \dfrac{1}{7}, \dfrac{55}{1}$$
Starting with the seed integer 2, successive iterations of the program
 produce the sequence:
15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, ..., 68, 4, 30, ..., 136, 8, 60, ...,
 544, 32, 240, ...
The powers of 2 that appear in this sequence are 22, 23, 25, ...
It can be shown that all the powers of 2 in this sequence have prime
 exponents and that all the primes appear as exponents of powers of 2,
 in proper order!
If someone uses the above Fractran program to solve Project Euler Problem
 7 (find the 10001st prime), how many iterations would be needed until
 the program produces 210001st prime ?

Problem 309
In the classic "Crossing Ladders" problem, we are given the lengths x
 and y of two ladders resting on the opposite walls of a narrow, level
 street. We are also given the height h above the street where the two
 ladders cross and we are asked to find the width of the street (w).

Here, we are only concerned with instances where all four variables are
 positive integers.
For example, if x = 70, y = 119 and h = 30, we can calculate that w = 56.
In fact, for integer values x, y, h and 0 < x < y < 200, there are only
 five triplets (x,y,h) producing integer solutions for w:
(70, 119, 30), (74, 182, 21), (87, 105, 35), (100, 116, 35) and (119,
 175, 40).
For integer values x, y, h and 0 < x < y < 1 000 000, how many triplets
 (x,y,h) produce integer solutions for w?

Problem 310

Alice and Bob play the game Nim Square.
Nim Square is just like ordinary three-heap normal play Nim, but the
 players may only remove a square number of stones from a heap.
The number of stones in the three heaps is represented by the ordered
 triple (a,b,c).
If 0≤a≤b≤c≤29 then the number of losing positions for the next
 player is 1160.


Find the number of losing positions for the next player if
 0≤a≤b≤c≤100 000.


Problem 311
ABCD is a convex, integer sided quadrilateral with 1 ≤ AB < BC <
 CD < AD.
BD has integer length. O is the midpoint of BD. AO has integer length.
We'll call ABCD a biclinic integral quadrilateral if AO = CO ≤ BO = DO.
For example, the following quadrilateral is a biclinic integral
 quadrilateral:
AB = 19, BC = 29, CD = 37, AD = 43, BD = 48 and AO = CO = 23.


Let B(N) be the number of distinct biclinic integral quadrilaterals ABCD
 that satisfy AB2+BC2+CD2+AD2 ≤ N.
We can verify that B(10 000) = 49 and B(1 000 000) = 38239.

Find B(10 000 000 000).


Problem 312
- A Sierpiński graph of order-1 (S1) is an equilateral triangle.
- Sn+1 is obtained from Sn by positioning three copies of Sn so that
 every pair of copies has one common corner.


Let C(n) be the number of cycles that pass exactly once through all the
 vertices of Sn.
For example, C(3) = 8 because eight such cycles can be drawn on S3,
 as shown below:


It can also be verified that :
C(1) = C(2) = 1
C(5) = 71328803586048
C(10 000) mod 108 = 37652224
C(10 000) mod 138 = 617720485
Find C(C(C(10 000))) mod 138.


Problem 313
In a sliding game a counter may slide horizontally or vertically into an
 empty space. The objective of the game is to move the red counter from
 the top left corner of a grid to the bottom right corner; the space
 always starts in the bottom right corner. For example, the following
 sequence of pictures show how the game can be completed in five moves
 on a 2 by 2 grid.

Let S(m,n) represent the minimum number of moves to complete the game
 on an m by n grid. For example, it can be verified that S(5,4) = 25.

There are exactly 5482 grids for which S(m,n) = p2, where p < 100
 is prime.
How many grids does S(m,n) = p2, where p < 106 is prime?

Problem 314

The moon has been opened up, and land can be obtained for free, but there
 is a catch. You have to build a wall around the land that you stake out,
 and building a wall on the moon is expensive. Every country has been
 allotted a 500 m by 500 m square area, but they will possess only that
 area which they wall in. 251001 posts have been placed in a rectangular
 grid with 1 meter spacing. The wall must be a closed series of straight
 lines, each line running from post to post.


The bigger countries of course have built a 2000 m wall enclosing the
 entire 250 000 m2 area. The Duchy of Grand Fenwick, has a tighter budget,
 and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape would
 get best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.


You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper.
For a 2000 meter wall enclosing the 250 000 m2 area the
enclosed-area/wall-length ratio is 125.
Although not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better:
 if you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides
 the area will be equal to π*2502 m2 and the perimeter will be π*500 m,
 so the enclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be 125.


However, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m,
 75 m and 75√2 m the total area becomes 238750 m2 and the perimeter
 becomes 1400+300√2 m. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length
 ratio of 130.87, which is significantly better.



Find the maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.
Give your answer rounded to 8 places behind the decimal point in the
 form abc.defghijk.


Problem 315

Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two "digital
 root" clocks.
A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots
 step by step.
When a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start
 the calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to
 the result.
For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: "137"
 → "11" → "2" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.
Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal
 (top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right,
 bottom-left, bottom-right).
Number "1" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number "4"
 is made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and
 bottom-right. Number "8" lights them all.
The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.
To turn on a "2" will cost 5 transitions, while a "7" will cost only
 4 transitions.
Sam and Max built two different clocks.
Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows "137", then the panel
 is turned off, then the next number ("11") is turned on, then the panel
 is turned off again and finally the last number ("2") is turned on and,
 after some time, off.
For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:"137"
:
(2 + 5 + 4) × 2 = 22 transitions ("137" on/off).
"11"
:
(2 + 2) × 2 = 8 transitions ("11" on/off).
"2"
:
(5) × 2 = 10 transitions ("2" on/off).

For a grand total of 40 transitions.

Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel,
 it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed
 for the next number.
For number 137, Max's clock requires:"137"
:
2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions ("137" on)
7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number
 "11").
"11"
:
0 transitions (number "11" is already turned on correctly)
3 transitions (to turn off the first "1" and the bottom part of the second
 "1";
the top part is common with number "2").
"2"
:
4 transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a "2")
5 transitions (to turn off number "2").

For a grand total of 30 transitions.

Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.
The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 107 and B =
 2×107.
Find the difference between the total number of transitions needed by
 Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.

Problem 316
Let p = p1 p2 p3 ... be an infinite sequence of random digits, selected
 from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.
It can be seen that p corresponds to the real number 0.p1 p2 p3 ....
It can also be seen that choosing a random real number from the interval
 [0,1) is equivalent to choosing an infinite sequence of random digits
 selected from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.
For any positive integer n with d decimal digits, let k be the smallest
 index such that pk, pk+1, ...pk+d-1 are the decimal digits of n, in
 the same order.
Also, let g(n) be the expected value of k; it can be proven that g(n)
 is always finite and, interestingly, always an integer number.
For example, if n = 535, then
for p = 31415926535897...., we get k = 9
for p = 355287143650049560000490848764084685354..., we get k = 36
etc and we find that g(535) = 1008.
Given that $\sum \limits_{n = 2}^{999} {g \left ( \left \lfloor
 \dfrac{10^6}{n} \right \rfloor \right )} = 27280188$, find $\sum
 \limits_{n = 2}^{999999} {g \left ( \left \lfloor \dfrac{10^{16}}{n}
 \right \rfloor \right )}$.
Note: $\lfloor x \rfloor$ represents the floor function.

Problem 317

A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It
 breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every
 direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.


We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform
 gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s2.


Find the volume (in m3) of the region through which the fragments move
 before reaching the ground.
Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.


Problem 318

Consider the real number $\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3$.
When we calculate the even powers of $\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3$
we get:
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^2 = 9.898979485566356 \dots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^4 = 97.98979485566356 \dots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^6 = 969.998969071069263 \dots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^8 = 9601.99989585502907 \dots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{10} = 95049.999989479221 \dots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{12} = 940897.9999989371855 \dots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{14} = 9313929.99999989263 \dots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{16} = 92198401.99999998915 \dots $

It looks as if the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the
 fractional part of these powers is non-decreasing.
In fact it can be proven that the fractional part of $(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt
 3)^{2 n}$ approaches $1$ for large $n$.


Consider all real numbers of the form $\sqrt p + \sqrt q$ with $p$

Let $C(p,q,n)$ be the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of
 the fractional part of $(\sqrt p + \sqrt q)^{ 2 n}$.


Let $N(p,q)$ be the minimal value of $n$ such that $C(p,q,n) \ge 2011$.

There are only five such sequences of length 2, namely:
{2,4}, {2,5}, {2,6}, {2,7} and {2,8}.
There are 293 such sequences of length 5; three examples are given below:
{2,5,11,25,55}, {2,6,14,36,88}, {2,8,22,64,181}.

Problem 321
A horizontal row comprising of 2n + 1 squares has n red counters placed
 at one end and n blue counters at the other end, being separated by a
 single empty square in the centre. For example, when n = 3.

A counter can move from one square to the next (slide) or can jump
 over another counter (hop) as long as the square next to that counter
 is unoccupied.

Let M(n) represent the minimum number of moves/actions to completely
 reverse the positions of the coloured counters; that is, move all the
 red counters to the right and all the blue counters to the left.
It can be verified M(3) = 15, which also happens to be a triangle number.
If we create a sequence based on the values of n for which M(n) is a
 triangle number then the first five terms would be:
1, 3, 10, 22, and 63, and their sum would be 99.
Find the sum of the first forty terms of this sequence.

(i.e. 0 ≤ yi < 232, every value equally likely).
For the sequence xi the following recursion is given:x0 = 0 and
xi = xi-1| yi-1, for i > 0. ( | is the bitwise-OR operator)
It can be seen that eventually there will be an index N such that xi =

Let f(n) represent the number of ways one can fill a 3×3×n tower
 with blocks of 2×1×1. You're allowed to rotate the blocks in any way
 you like; however, rotations, reflections etc of the tower itself are
 counted as distinct.
For example (with q = 100000007) :f(2) = 229,f(4) = 117805,f(10) mod q =
 96149360,f(103) mod q = 24806056,f(106) mod q = 30808124.
Find f(1010000) mod 100000007.

Problem 325
A game is played with two piles of stones and two players.
On each player's turn, the player may remove a number of stones from
 the larger pile.
The number of stones removed must be a positive multiple of the number
 of stones in the smaller pile.
E.g. Let the ordered pair $(6,14)$ describe a configuration with 6 stones
 in the smaller pile and 14 stones in the larger pile, then the first
 player can remove 6 or 12 stones from the larger pile.
The player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.
A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win. For
 example, $(1,5)$, $(2,6)$, and $(3,12)$ are winning configurations
 because the first player can immediately remove all stones in the
 second pile.
A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win,
 no matter what the first player does. For example, $(2,3)$ and $(3,4)$
 are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration
 for the second player.
Define $S(N)$ as the sum of $(x_i + y_i)$ for all losing configurations
 $(x_i, y_i), 0 \lt x_i \lt y_i \le N$.
We can verify that $S(10) = 211$ and $S(10^4) = 230312207313$.
Find $S(10^{16}) \mod 7^{10}$.

Problem 326

Let $a_n$ be a sequence recursively defined by:$\quad
 a_1=1,\quad\displaystyle a_n=\biggl(\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}k\cdot
 a_k\biggr)\bmod n$.


So the first 10 elements of $a_n$ are: 1,1,0,3,0,3,5,4,1,9.

Let f(N,M) represent the number of pairs (p,q) such that:

$$
\def\htmltext#1{\style{font-family:inherit;}{\text{#1}}}
1\le p\le q\le N
 \quad\htmltext{and}\quad\biggl(\sum_{i=p}^qa_i\biggr)\bmod M=0
$$


It can be seen that f(10,10)=4 with the pairs (3,3), (5,5), (7,9) and
 (9,10).


You are also given that f(104,103)=97158.

Find f(1012,106).


Problem 327
A series of three rooms are connected to each other by automatic doors.

Each door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door
 automatically closes and that security card cannot be used again. A
 machine at the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but
 each room (including the starting room) contains scanners and if they
 detect that you are holding more than three security cards or if they
 detect an unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors will
 become permanently locked. However, each room contains a box where you
 may safely store any number of security cards for use at a later stage.
If you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as
 you entered room 3 you would have used all three cards and would be
 trapped in that room forever!
However, if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is
 possible. For example, you could enter room 1 using your first card,
 place one card in the storage box, and use your third card to exit the
 room back to the start. Then after collecting three more cards from
 the dispensing machine you could use one to enter room 1 and collect
 the card you placed in the box a moment ago. You now have three cards
 again and will be able to travel through the remaining three doors. This
 method allows you to travel through all three rooms using six security
 cards in total.
It is possible to travel through six rooms using a total of 123 security
 cards while carrying a maximum of 3 cards.
Let C be the maximum number of cards which can be carried at any time.
Let R be the number of rooms to travel through.
Let M(C,R) be the minimum number of cards required from the dispensing
 machine to travel through R rooms carrying up to a maximum of C cards
 at any time.
For example, M(3,6)=123 and M(4,6)=23.And, ∑ M(C,6)=146 for 3 ≤
 C ≤ 4.
You are given that ∑ M(C,10)=10382 for 3 ≤ C ≤ 10.
Find ∑ M(C,30) for 3 ≤ C ≤ 40.

We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers
 {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions.
Each number (question) we ask, has a cost equal to the number asked and
 we get one of three possible answers: "Your guess is lower than the
 hidden number", or "Yes, that's it!", or "Your guess is higher than
 the hidden number".
Given the value of n, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost
 (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) for the worst possible
 case. E.g.
If n=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number "2". The answer
 will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).
If n=8, we might decide to use a "binary search" type of strategy: Our
 first question would be "4" and if the hidden number is higher than 4
 we will need one or two additional questions.
Let our second question be "6". If the hidden number is still higher
 than 6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between
 7 and 8.
Thus, our third question will be "7" and the total cost for this
 worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=17.
We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for n=8, by asking "5"
 as our first question.
If we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second
 question will be "7", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number
 is (for a total cost of 5+7=12).
If we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question
 will be "3" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question
 will be "1", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=9.
Since 12>9, the worst-case cost for this strategy is 12. That's better
 than what we achieved previously with the "binary search" strategy;
 it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for n=8.
Let C(n) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for n,
 as described above.
Thus C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 2 and C(8) = 12.
Similarly, C(100) = 400 and $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{100} {C(n)} = 17575$.
Find $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{200000} {C(n)}$ .

Problem 329
Susan has a prime frog.
Her frog is jumping around over 500 squares numbered 1 to 500.
He can only jump one square to the left or to the right, with equal
 probability, and he cannot jump outside the range [1;500].(if it lands
 at either end, it automatically jumps to the only available square on
 the next move.)


When he is on a square with a prime number on it, he croaks 'P' (PRIME)
 with probability 2/3 or 'N' (NOT PRIME) with probability 1/3 just before
 jumping to the next square.
When he is on a square with a number on it that is not a prime he croaks
 'P' with probability 1/3 or 'N' with probability 2/3 just before jumping
 to the next square.


Given that the frog's starting position is random with the same
 probability for every square, and given that she listens to his
 first 15 croaks, what is the probability that she hears the sequence
 PPPPNNPPPNPPNPN?

Give your answer as a fraction p/q in reduced form.


Problem 330
An infinite sequence of real numbers a(n) is defined for all integers
 n as follows:
$$a(n) = \begin{cases}
1 & n \lt 0\\
\sum \limits_{i = 1}^{\infty}{\dfrac{a(n - i)}{i!}} & n \ge 0
\end{cases}$$

For example,
$a(0) = \dfrac{1}{1!} + \dfrac{1}{2!} + \dfrac{1}{3!} + \cdots = e - 1$
$a(1) = \dfrac{e - 1}{1!} + \dfrac{1}{2!} + \dfrac{1}{3!} + \cdots =
 2e - 3$
$a(2) = \dfrac{2e - 3}{1!} + \dfrac{e - 1}{2!} + \dfrac{1}{3!} + \cdots =
 \dfrac{7}{2}e - 6$
with $e = 2.7182818...$ being Euler's constant.
It can be shown that $a(n)$ is of the form $\dfrac{A(n)e + B(n)}{n!}$
 for integers $A(n)$ and $B(n)$.
For example, $a(10) = \dfrac{328161643e - 652694486}{10!}$.
Find $A(10^9) + B(10^9)$ and give your answer mod 77 777 777.

Problem 331
N×N disks are placed on a square game board. Each disk has a black side
 and white side.
At each turn, you may choose a disk and flip all the disks in the same
 row and the same column as this disk: thus 2×N-1 disks are flipped. The
 game ends when all disks show their white side. The following example
 shows a game on a 5×5 board.

It can be proven that 3 is the minimal number of turns to finish this
 game.
The bottom left disk on the N×N board has coordinates (0,0);
the bottom right disk has coordinates (N-1,0) and the top left disk has
 coordinates (0,N-1).
Let CN be the following configuration of a board with N×N disks:
A disk at (x,y) satisfying $N - 1 \le \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \lt N$, shows
 its black side; otherwise, it shows its white side. C5 is shown above.
Let T(N) be the minimal number of turns to finish a game starting from
 configuration CN or 0 if configuration CN is unsolvable.
We have shown that T(5)=3. You are also given that T(10)=29 and T(1
 000)=395253.
Find $\sum \limits_{i = 3}^{31} {T(2^i - i)}$.

Problem 332
A spherical triangle is a figure formed on the surface of a sphere by
 three great circular arcs intersecting pairwise in three vertices.

Let C(r) be the sphere with the centre (0,0,0) and radius r.
Let Z(r) be the set of points on the surface of C(r) with integer
 coordinates.
Let T(r) be the set of spherical triangles with vertices in Z(r).
Degenerate spherical triangles, formed by three points on the same great
 arc, are not included in T(r).
Let A(r) be the area of the smallest spherical triangle in T(r).
For example A(14) is 3.294040 rounded to six decimal places.
Find $\sum \limits_{r = 1}^{50} {A(r)}$. Give your answer rounded to
 six decimal places.

Problem 333
All positive integers can be partitioned in such a way that each and
 every term of the partition can be expressed as 2ix3j, where i,j ≥ 0.
Let's consider only such partitions where none of the terms can divide
 any of the other terms.
For example, the partition of 17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (21x30 + 21x31 + 20x32)
 would not be valid since 2 can divide 6. Neither would the partition
 17 = 16 + 1 = (24x30 + 20x30) since 1 can divide 16. The only valid
 partition of 17 would be 8 + 9 = (23x30 + 20x32).
Many integers have more than one valid partition, the first being 11
 having the following two partitions.
11 = 2 + 9 = (21x30 + 20x32)
11 = 8 + 3 = (23x30 + 20x31)
Let's define P(n) as the number of valid partitions of n. For example,
 P(11) = 2.
Let's consider only the prime integers q which would have a single valid
 partition such as P(17).
The sum of the primes q <100 such that P(q)=1 equals 233.
Find the sum of the primes q <1000000 such that P(q)=1.

Problem 334
In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight
 line.
Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.
A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing
 two beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent
 bowls. The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.
For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans
 respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves
 will finish the game:

You are given the following sequences:

$\def\htmltext#1{\style{font-family:inherit;}{\text{#1}}}$
$
\begin{align}
\qquad t_0 &= 123456,\cr
\qquad t_i &= \cases{
\;\;\frac{t_{i-1}}{2},&$\htmltext{if }t_{i-1}\htmltext{ is even}$\cr
\left\lfloor\frac{t_{i-1}}{2}\right\rfloor\oplus 926252,&$\htmltext{if
 }t_{i-1}\htmltext{ is odd}$\cr}\cr
&\qquad\htmltext{where }\lfloor x\rfloor\htmltext{ is the floor function
 }\cr
&\qquad\!\htmltext{and }\oplus\htmltext{is the bitwise XOR operator.}\cr
\qquad b_i &= (t_i\bmod2^{11}) + 1.\cr
\end{align}
$

The first two terms of the last sequence are $b_1 = 289$ and $b_2 = 145$.
If we start with $b_1$ and $b_2$ beans in two adjacent bowls, $3419100$
 moves would be required to finish the game.
Consider now $1500$ adjacent bowls containing $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{1500}$
 beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. Find how many moves
 it takes before the game ends.

Problem 335
Whenever Peter feels bored, he places some bowls, containing one bean
 each, in a circle. After this, he takes all the beans out of a certain
 bowl and drops them one by one in the bowls going clockwise. He repeats
 this, starting from the bowl he dropped the last bean in, until the
 initial situation appears again. For example with 5 bowls he acts
 as follows:

So with 5 bowls it takes Peter 15 moves to return to the initial
 situation.
Let M(x) represent the number of moves required to return to the initial
 situation, starting with x bowls. Thus, M(5) = 15. It can also be
 verified that M(100) = 10920.
Find $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{10^{18}} M(2^k + 1)$. Give your answer
 modulo 79.

Problem 336
A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However,
 sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not
 in the correct order.
To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating
 turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the
 train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached
 with it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the
 carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as
 necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.
Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages
 are separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct
 order has been achieved.
However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency,
 so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the
 correct place, then carriage B, and so on.
Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which
 we shall call maximix arrangements, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring
 him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they
 could be solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for
 DACB is shown below.

It can be verified that there are 24 maximix arrangements for six
 carriages, of which the tenth lexicographic maximix arrangement is
 DFAECB.
Find the 2011th lexicographic maximix arrangement for eleven carriages.

Let {a1, a2,..., an} be an integer sequence of length n such that:
a1 = 6
for all 1 ≤ i < n : φ(ai) < φ(ai+1) < ai < ai+11
Let S(N) be the number of such sequences with an ≤ N.
For example, S(10) = 4: {6}, {6, 8}, {6, 8, 9} and {6, 10}.
We can verify that S(100) = 482073668 and S(10 000) mod 108 = 73808307.
Find S(20 000 000) mod 108.

Problem 338
A rectangular sheet of grid paper with integer dimensions w × h is
 given. Its grid spacing is 1.
When we cut the sheet along the grid lines into two pieces and rearrange
 those pieces without overlap, we can make new rectangles with different
 dimensions.
For example, from a sheet with dimensions 9 × 4 , we can make rectangles
 with dimensions 18 × 2, 12 × 3 and 6 × 6 by cutting and rearranging
 as below:


Similarly, from a sheet with dimensions 9 × 8 , we can make rectangles
 with dimensions 18 × 4 and 12 × 6 .
For a pair w and h, let F(w,h) be the number of distinct rectangles that
 can be made from a sheet with dimensions w × h .
For example, F(2,1) = 0, F(2,2) = 1, F(9,4) = 3 and F(9,8) = 2.
Note that rectangles congruent to the initial one are not counted
 in F(w,h).
Note also that rectangles with dimensions w × h and dimensions h × w
 are not considered distinct.
For an integer N, let G(N) be the sum of F(w,h) for all pairs w and h
 which satisfy 0 < h ≤ w ≤ N.
We can verify that G(10) = 55, G(103) = 971745 and G(105) = 9992617687.
Find G(1012). Give your answer modulo 108.

Problem 339

"And he came towards a valley, through which ran a river; and the borders
 of the valley were wooded, and on each side of the river were level
 meadows. And on one side of the river he saw a flock of white sheep,
 and on the other a flock of black sheep. And whenever one of the white
 sheep bleated, one of the black sheep would cross over and become white;
 and when one of the black sheep bleated, one of the white sheep would
 cross over and become black."en.wikisource.org



Initially each flock consists of n sheep. Each sheep (regardless of
 colour) is equally likely to be the next sheep to bleat. After a sheep
 has bleated and a sheep from the other flock has crossed over, Peredur
 may remove a number of white sheep in order to maximize the expected
 final number of black sheep. Let E(n) be the expected final number of
 black sheep if Peredur uses an optimal strategy.

Problem 340

For fixed integers a, b, c, define the crazy function F(n) as follows:
F(n) = n - c for all n > b
F(n) = F(a + F(a + F(a + F(a + n)))) for all n ≤ b.

Also, define $S(a, b, c) = \sum \limits_{n = 0}^{b} {F(n)}$.

For example, if a = 50, b = 2000 and c = 40, then F(0) = 3240 and F(2000)
 = 2040.
Also, S(50, 2000, 40) = 5204240.


Find the last 9 digits of S(217, 721, 127).

The Golomb's self-describing sequence $(G(n))$ is the only nondecreasing
 sequence of natural numbers such that $n$ appears exactly $G(n)$ times
 in the sequence. The values of $G(n)$ for the first few $n$ are

Consider the number 50.
502 = 2500 = 22 × 54, so φ(2500) = 2 × 4 × 53 = 8 × 53 = 23 × 53. 1
So 2500 is a square and  φ(2500) is a cube.

Problem 343
For any positive integer k, a finite sequence ai of fractions xi/yi is
 defined by:
a1 = 1/k and
ai = (xi-1+1)/(yi-1-1) reduced to lowest terms for i>1.
When ai reaches some integer n, the sequence stops. (That is, when yi=1.)
Define f(k) = n.
For example, for k = 20:


1/20 → 2/19 → 3/18 = 1/6 → 2/5 → 3/4 → 4/3 → 5/2 → 6/1 = 6


So f(20) = 6.

Problem 344
One variant of N.G. de Bruijn's silver dollar game can be described
 as follows:
On a strip of squares a number of coins are placed, at most one coin
 per square. Only one coin, called the silver dollar, has any value. Two
 players take turns making moves. At each turn a player must make either
 a regular or a special move.
A regular move consists of selecting one coin and moving it one or more
 squares to the left. The coin cannot move out of the strip or jump on
 or over another coin.
Alternatively, the player can choose to make the special move of pocketing
 the leftmost coin rather than making a regular move. If no regular
 moves are possible, the player is forced to pocket the leftmost coin.
The winner is the player who pockets the silver dollar.


A winning configuration is an arrangement of coins on the strip where
 the first player can force a win no matter what the second player does.
Let W(n,c) be the number of winning configurations for a strip of n
 squares, c worthless coins and one silver dollar.
You are given that W(10,2) = 324 and W(100,10) = 1514704946113500.

Problem 346

The number 7 is special, because 7 is 111 written in base 2, and 11
 written in base 6 (i.e. 710 = 116 = 1112). In other words, 7 is a
 repunit in at least two bases b > 1.

Problem 347

The largest integer ≤ 100 that is only divisible by both the primes
 2 and 3 is 96, as 96=32*3=25*3.
For two distinct primes p and q let M(p,q,N) be the largest positive
 integer ≤N only divisible
by both p and q and M(p,q,N)=0 if such a positive integer does not exist.


E.g. M(2,3,100)=96.
M(3,5,100)=75 and not 90 because 90 is divisible by 2 ,3 and 5.
Also M(2,73,100)=0 because there does not exist a positive integer ≤
 100 that is divisible by both 2 and 73.


Let S(N) be the sum of all distinct M(p,q,N).
S(100)=2262.

Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some
 of them in more than one way.
Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a
 square and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 4 different ways.
For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in
 exactly 4 different ways:

Problem 349

An ant moves on a regular grid of squares that are coloured either black
 or white.
The ant is always oriented in one of the cardinal directions (left,
 right, up or down) and moves from square to adjacent square according
 to the following rules:
- if it is on a black square, it flips the colour of the square to white,
 rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise and moves forward one square.
- if it is on a white square, it flips the colour of the square to black,
 rotates 90 degrees clockwise and moves forward one square.

Starting with a grid that is entirely white, how many squares are black
 after 1018 moves of the ant?


Problem 350
A list of size n is a sequence of n natural numbers. Examples are (2,4,6),
 (2,6,4), (10,6,15,6), and (11).

The greatest common divisor, or gcd, of a list is the largest natural
 number that divides all entries of the list. Examples: gcd(2,6,4) = 2,
 gcd(10,6,15,6) = 1 and gcd(11) = 11.

The least common multiple, or lcm, of a list is the smallest natural
 number divisible by each entry of the list. Examples: lcm(2,6,4) = 12,
 lcm(10,6,15,6) = 30 and lcm(11) = 11.

Let f(G, L, N) be the number of lists of size N with gcd ≥ G and lcm
 ≤ L. For example:

f(10, 100, 1) = 91.
f(10, 100, 2) = 327.
f(10, 100, 3) = 1135.
f(10, 100, 1000) mod 1014 = 3286053.

A hexagonal orchard of order n is a triangular lattice made up of points
 within a regular hexagon with side n. The following is an example of
 a hexagonal orchard of order 5:




Highlighted in green are the points which are hidden from the center by
 a point closer to it. It can be seen that for a hexagonal orchard of
 order 5, 30 points are hidden from the center.


Let H(n) be the number of points hidden from the center in a hexagonal
 orchard of order n.


H(5) = 30. H(10) = 138. H(1 000) = 1177848.


Find H(100 000 000).


Problem 352

Each one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus,
 known to affect 2% of the sheep population.
An accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples,
 producing a clear positive / negative result, but it is very
 time-consuming and expensive.


Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of
 performing 25 separate tests, the following procedure can be used
 instead:
The sheep are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group.
For each group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is
 performed. Then,
If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to
 be virus-free.
If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a
 separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).

Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02,
 the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:
Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.985 = 0.9039207968.
Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968
 = 0.0960792032.

Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032
 × 5 = 1.480396016.
Consequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only
 1.480396016 × 5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of
 more than 70% !


Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient,
 it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test
 is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused
 by mixing different samples). E.g.:
We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It
 can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be
 negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only
 be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.
If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the
 first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a
 test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).
We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals
 in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total
 expected number of tests will be minimised.

To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction
 we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever
 we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample
 must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must
 be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.

For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing
 scheme (we'll call it the optimal strategy) requires an average of just
 4.155452 tests!



Using the optimal strategy, let T(s,p) represent the average number of
 tests needed to screen a flock of s sheep for a virus having probability
 p to be present in any individual.
Thus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25,
 0.10) = 12.702124.


Find ∑ T(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.
Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.


Problem 353

A moon could be described by the sphere $C(r)$ with centre $(0,0,0)$
 and radius $r$.


There are stations on the moon at the points on the surface of $C(r)$
 with integer coordinates. The station at $(0,0,r)$ is called North Pole
 station, the station at $(0,0,-r)$ is called South Pole station.


All stations are connected with each other via the shortest road on
 the great arc through the stations. A journey between two stations
 is risky. If d is the length of the road between two stations,
 $\left(\frac{d}{\pi r}\right)^2$ is a measure for the risk of the journey
 (let us call it the risk of the road). If the journey includes more
 than two stations, the risk of the journey is the sum of risks of the
 used roads.


A direct journey from  the North Pole station to the South Pole station
 has the length $\pi r$ and risk 1. The journey from the North Pole
 station to the South Pole station via $(0,r,0)$ has the same length,
 but a smaller risk:
\[
\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}\pi r}{\pi r}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}\pi
 r}{\pi r}\right)^2=0.5
\]


The minimal risk of a journey from the North Pole station to the South
 Pole station on $C(r)$ is $M(r)$.

0588235294117647 × 3 = 1764705882352941
...
0588235294117647 × 16 = 9411764705882352

Problem 359

An infinite number of people (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.) are lined up to
 get a room at Hilbert's newest infinite hotel. The hotel contains an
 infinite number of floors (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.), and each floor
 contains an infinite number of rooms (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.).


Initially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the nth
 person is assigned a room: person n gets the first vacant room in the
 lowest numbered floor satisfying either of the following:
the floor is empty
the floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in that
 floor is person m, then m + n is a perfect square

Person 1 gets room 1 in floor 1 since floor 1 is empty.
Person 2 does not get room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 2 = 3 is not a perfect
 square.
Person 2 instead gets room 1 in floor 2 since floor 2 is empty.
Person 3 gets room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 3 = 4 is a perfect square.


Eventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.


Define P(f, r) to be n if person n occupies room r in floor f, and 0 if
 no person occupies the room. Here are a few examples:
P(1, 1) = 1
P(1, 2) = 3
P(2, 1) = 2
P(10, 20) = 440
P(25, 75) = 4863
P(99, 100) = 19454

 71328803586048 and give the last 8 digits as your answer.

Problem 361
The Thue-Morse sequence {Tn} is a binary sequence satisfying:
T0 = 0
T2n = Tn
T2n+1 = 1 - Tn

The first several terms of {Tn} are given as follows:
01101001100101101001011001101001....


We define {An} as the sorted sequence of integers such that the binary
 expression of each element appears as a subsequence in {Tn}.
For example, the decimal number 18 is expressed as 10010 in binary. 10010
 appears in {Tn} (T8 to T12), so 18 is an element of {An}.
The decimal number 14 is expressed as 1110 in binary. 1110 never appears
 in {Tn}, so 14 is not an element of {An}.


The first several terms of An are given as follows:
n0123456789101112…An012345691011121318…

Consider the number 54.

 than 1:

If we require that the factors are all squarefree only two ways remain:
 3×3×6 and 2×3×3×3.


Let's call Fsf(n) the number of ways n can be factored into one or more
 squarefree factors larger than 1, so
Fsf(54)=2.

Problem 363
A cubic Bézier curve is defined by four points: $P_0, P_1, P_2,$
 and $P_3$.

The curve is constructed as follows:
On the segments $P_0 P_1$, $P_1 P_2$, and $P_2 P_3$ the points $Q_0, Q_1,$
 and $Q_2$ are drawn such that $\dfrac{P_0 Q_0}{P_0 P_1} = \dfrac{P_1
 Q_1}{P_1 P_2} = \dfrac{P_2 Q_2}{P_2 P_3} = t$, with $t$ in $[0, 1]$.
On the segments $Q_0 Q_1$ and $Q_1 Q_2$ the points $R_0$ and $R_1$
 are drawn such that
$\dfrac{Q_0 R_0}{Q_0 Q_1} = \dfrac{Q_1 R_1}{Q_1 Q_2} = t$ for the same
 value of $t$.
On the segment $R_0 R_1$ the point $B$ is drawn such that $\dfrac{R_0
 B}{R_0 R_1} = t$ for the same value of $t$.
The Bézier curve defined by the points $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$ is the locus
 of $B$ as $Q_0$ takes all possible positions on the segment $P_0 P_1$.
(Please note that for all points the value of $t$ is the same.)
From the construction it is clear that the Bézier curve will be tangent
 to the segments $P_0 P_1$ in $P_0$ and $P_2 P_3$ in $P_3$.
A cubic Bézier curve with $P_0 = (1, 0), P_1 = (1, v), P_2 = (v, 1),$
 and $P_3 = (0, 1)$ is used to approximate a quarter circle.
The value $v \gt 0$ is chosen such that the area enclosed by the lines
 $O P_0, OP_3$ and the curve is equal to $\dfrac{\pi}{4}$ (the area of
 the quarter circle).
By how many percent does the length of the curve differ from the length
 of the quarter circle?
That is, if $L$ is the length of the curve, calculate $100 \times \dfrac{L
 - \frac{\pi}{2}}{\frac{\pi}{2}}$

Problem 366

Two players, Anton and Bernhard, are playing the following game.
There is one pile of n stones.
The first player may remove any positive number of stones, but not the
 whole pile.
Thereafter, each player may remove at most twice the number of stones
 his opponent took on the previous move.
The player who removes the last stone wins.


E.g. n=5
If the first player takes anything more than one stone the next player
 will be able to take all remaining stones.
If the first player takes one stone, leaving four, his opponent will
 take also one stone, leaving three stones.
The first player cannot take all three because he may take at most 2x1=2
 stones. So let's say he takes also one stone, leaving 2. The second
 player can take the two remaining stones and wins.
So 5 is a losing position for the first player.
For some winning positions there is more than one possible move for the
 first player.
E.g. when n=17 the first player can remove one or four stones.


Let M(n) be the maximum number of stones the first player can take from
 a winning position at his first turn and M(n)=0 for any other position.


∑ M(n) for n≤100 is 728.


Find  ∑ M(n) for n≤1018.

Problem 367

Bozo sort, not to be confused with the slightly less efficient bogo sort,
 consists out of checking if the input sequence is sorted and if not
 swapping randomly two elements. This is repeated until eventually the
 sequence is sorted.


If we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input
 the expectation value of the number of swaps, averaged over all 4! input
 sequences is 24.75.
The already sorted sequence takes 0 steps.


In this problem we consider the following variant on bozo sort.
If the sequence is not in order we pick three elements at random and
 shuffle these three elements randomly.
All 3!=6 permutations of those three elements are equally likely.
The already sorted sequence will take 0 steps.
If we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input
 the expectation value of the number of shuffles, averaged over all
 4! input sequences is 27.5.
Consider as input sequences the permutations of the first 11 natural
 numbers.
Averaged over all 11! input sequences, what is the expected number of
 shuffles this sorting algorithm will perform?

The  harmonic series  $1 + \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{3} + \dfrac{1}{4}
 + ...$ is well known to be divergent.
If we however omit from this series every term where the denominator
 has a 9 in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately
 22.9206766193.
This modified harmonic series is called the Kempner series.
Let us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from
 the harmonic series every term where the denominator has 3 or more
 equal consecutive digits.
One can verify that out of the first 1200 terms of the harmonic series,
 only 20 terms will be omitted.
These 20 omitted terms are:
$$\dfrac{1}{111}, \dfrac{1}{222}, \dfrac{1}{333}, \dfrac{1}{444},
 \dfrac{1}{555}, \dfrac{1}{666}, \dfrac{1}{777}, \dfrac{1}{888},

An integer partition of a number n is a way of writing n as a sum of
 positive integers.

Problem 376

Consider the following set of dice with nonstandard pips:


Die A: 1 4 4 4 4 4
Die B: 2 2 2 5 5 5
Die C: 3 3 3 3 3 6

A game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The
 player who rolls the highest value wins.


If the first player picks die A and the second player picks die B we get
P(second player wins) = 7/12 > 1/2

If the first player picks die B and the second player picks die C we get
P(second player wins) = 7/12 > 1/2

If the first player picks die C and the second player picks die A we get
P(second player wins) = 25/36 > 1/2

So whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick
 another die and have a larger than 50% chance of winning.
A set of dice having this property is called a nontransitive set of dice.


We wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We
 will assume the following conditions:There are three six-sided dice
 with each side having between 1 and N pips, inclusive.
Dice with the same set of pips are equal, regardless of which side on
 the die the pips are located.
The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll
 the same value neither player wins.
The sets of dice {A,B,C}, {B,C,A} and {C,A,B} are the same set.

For N = 7 we find there are 9780 such sets.

(7-1)! + (7-2)! + (7-3)! + (7-4)! + (7-5)! = 6! + 5! + 4! + 3! + 2! =
 720+120+24+6+2 = 872.
As 872 mod(7) = 4, S(7) = 4.


It can be verified that ∑ S(p) = 480 for 5 ≤ p < 100.

Problem 382

A polygon is a flat shape consisting of straight line segments that
 are joined to form a closed chain or circuit. A polygon consists of at
 least three sides and does not self-intersect.


A set S of positive numbers is said to generate a polygon P if: no two
 sides of P are the same length, the length of every side of P is in S,
 and S contains no other value.

For example:
The set {3, 4, 5} generates a polygon with sides 3, 4, and 5 (a triangle).
The set {6, 9, 11, 24} generates a polygon with sides 6, 9, 11, and 24
 (a quadrilateral).
The sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4, 9} do not generate any polygon at all.

Consider the sequence s, defined as follows:s1 = 1, s2 = 2, s3 = 3
sn = sn-1 + sn-3 for n > 3.

Let Un be the set {s1, s2, ..., sn}. For example, U10 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
 9, 13, 19, 28, 41}.
Let f(n) be the number of subsets of Un which generate at least one
 polygon.
For example, f(5) = 7, f(10) = 501 and f(25) = 18635853.


Find the last 9 digits of f(1018).

 2·f5(i!) and 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
It can be verified that T5(103) = 68 and T5(109) = 2408210.


Find T5(1018).


Problem 384
Define the sequence a(n) as the number of adjacent pairs of ones in the
 binary expansion of n (possibly overlapping).
E.g.: a(5) = a(1012) = 0, a(6) = a(1102) = 1, a(7) = a(1112) = 2
Define the sequence b(n) = (-1)a(n).
This sequence is called the Rudin-Shapiro sequence.
Also consider the summatory sequence of b(n): $s(n) = \sum \limits_{i =
 0}^{n} {b(i)}$.
The first couple of values of these sequences are:
n        0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
a(n)     0     0     0     1     0     0     1     2
b(n)     1     1     1    -1     1     1    -1     1
s(n)     1     2     3     2     3     4     3     4
The sequence s(n) has the remarkable property that all elements are
 positive and every positive integer k occurs exactly k times.
Define g(t,c), with 1 ≤ c ≤ t, as the index in s(n) for which t
 occurs for the c'th time in s(n).
E.g.: g(3,3) = 6, g(4,2) = 7 and g(54321,12345) = 1220847710.
Let F(n) be the fibonacci sequence defined by:
F(0)=F(1)=1 and
F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) for n>1.
Define GF(t)=g(F(t),F(t-1)).
Find $\sum$ GF(t) for 2≤t≤45.

Problem 385

For any triangle T in the plane, it can be shown that there is a unique
 ellipse with largest area that is completely inside T.



For a given n, consider triangles T such that:
- the vertices of T have integer coordinates with absolute value ≤
 n, and
- the foci1 of the largest-area ellipse inside T are (√13,0) and
 (-√13,0).
Let A(n) be the sum of the areas of all such triangles.


For example, if n = 8, there are two such triangles. Their vertices are
 (-4,-3),(-4,3),(8,0) and (4,3),(4,-3),(-8,0), and the area of each
 triangle is 36. Thus A(8) = 36 + 36 = 72.


It can be verified that A(10) = 252, A(100) = 34632 and A(1000) = 3529008.


Find A(1 000 000 000).


1The foci (plural of focus) of an ellipse are two points A and B such that
 for every point P on the boundary of the ellipse, AP + PB is constant.


Problem 386
Let n be an integer and S(n) be the set of factors of n.
A subset A of S(n) is called an antichain of S(n) if A contains only
 one element or if none of the elements of A divides any of the other
 elements of A.
For example: S(30) = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30}
{2, 5, 6} is not an antichain of S(30).
{2, 3, 5} is an antichain of S(30).
Let N(n) be the maximum length of an antichain of S(n).
Find ∑ N(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 108

Problem 387
A Harshad or Niven number is a number that is divisible by the sum of
 its digits.
201 is a Harshad number because it is divisible by 3 (the sum of its
 digits.)
When we truncate the last digit from 201, we get 20, which is a Harshad
 number.
When we truncate the last digit from 20, we get 2, which is also a
 Harshad number.
Let's call a Harshad number that, while recursively truncating the
 last digit, always results in a Harshad number a right truncatable
 Harshad number.
Also:
201/3=67 which is prime.
Let's call a Harshad number that, when divided by the sum of its digits,
 results in a prime a strong Harshad number.
Now take the number 2011 which is prime.
When we truncate the last digit from it we get 201, a strong Harshad
 number that is also right truncatable.
Let's call such primes strong, right truncatable Harshad primes.
You are given that the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad
 primes less than 10000 is 90619.
Find the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less
 than 1014.

Problem 390
Consider the triangle with sides $\sqrt 5$, $\sqrt {65}$ and $\sqrt {68}$.
It can be shown that this triangle has area $9$.
$S(n)$ is the sum of the areas of  all triangles with sides
 $\sqrt{1+b^2}$, $\sqrt {1+c^2}$ and $\sqrt{b^2+c^2}\,$ (for positive
 integers $b$ and $c$) that have an integral area not exceeding $n$.
The example triangle has $b=2$ and $c=8$.
$S(10^6)=18018206$.
Find $S(10^{10})$.

Problem 391
Let $s_k$ be the number of 1’s when writing the numbers from 0 to $k$
 in binary.
For example, writing 0 to 5 in binary, we have $0, 1, 10, 11, 100,
 101$. There are seven 1’s, so $s_5 = 7$.
The sequence $S = \{s_k : k \ge 0\}$ starts $\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9,
 12, ...\}$.
A game is played by two players. Before the game starts, a number $n$
 is chosen. A counter $c$ starts at 0. At each turn, the player chooses a
 number from 1 to $n$ (inclusive) and increases $c$ by that number. The
 resulting value of $c$ must be a member of $S$. If there are no more
 valid moves, then the player loses.
For example, with $n = 5$ and starting with $c = 0$:
Player 1 chooses 4, so $c$ becomes $0 + 4 = 4$.
Player 2 chooses 5, so $c$ becomes $4 + 5 = 9$.
Player 1 chooses 3, so $c$ becomes $9 + 3 = 12$.
etc.
Note that $c$ must always belong to $S$, and each player can increase $c$
 by at most $n$.
Let $M(n)$ be the highest number that the first player could choose at
 the start to force a win, and $M(n) = 0$ if there is no such move. For
 example, $M(2) = 2$, $M(7) = 1$, and $M(20) = 4$.
It can be verified that $\sum{M(n)^3} = 8150$ for $1 \le n \le 20$.
Find $\sum{M(n)^3}$ for $1 \le n \le 1000$.

A rectilinear grid is an orthogonal grid where the spacing between the
 gridlines does not have to be equidistant.
An example of such grid is logarithmic graph paper.


Consider rectilinear grids in the Cartesian coordinate system with the
 following properties:The gridlines are parallel to the axes of the
 Cartesian coordinate system.There are N+2 vertical and N+2 horizontal
 gridlines. Hence there are (N+1) x (N+1) rectangular cells.The equations
 of the two outer vertical gridlines are x = -1 and x = 1.The equations
 of the two outer horizontal gridlines are y = -1 and y = 1.The grid
 cells are colored red if they overlap with the unit circle, black
 otherwise.For this problem we would like you to find the positions of
 the remaining N inner horizontal and N inner vertical gridlines so that
 the area occupied by the red cells is minimized.

 the decimal point is 3.3469640797.

Give as your answer the area occupied by the red cells rounded to 10
 digits behind the decimal point.


Problem 393

An  n×n grid of squares contains  n2 ants, one ant per square.
All ants decide to move simultaneously to an adjacent square (usually
 4 possibilities, except for ants on the edge of the grid or at the
 corners).
We define f(n) to be the number of ways this can happen without any ants
 ending on the same square and without any two ants crossing the same
 edge between two squares.


You are given that f(4) = 88.
Find  f(10).


Problem 394

Jeff eats a pie in an unusual way.
The pie is circular. He starts with slicing an initial cut in the pie
 along a radius.
While there is at least a given fraction F of pie left, he performs the
 following procedure:
- He makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what is
 remaining of the pie border, any point on the remaining pie border
 equally likely. This will divide the remaining pie into three pieces.
- Going counterclockwise from the initial cut, he takes the first two
 pie pieces and eats them.
When less than a fraction F of pie remains, he does not repeat this
 procedure. Instead, he eats all of the remaining pie.




For x ≥ 1, let E(x) be the expected number of times Jeff repeats the
 procedure above with F = 1/x.
It can be verified that  E(1) = 1, E(2) ≈ 1.2676536759, and E(7.5)
 ≈ 2.1215732071.


Find E(40) rounded to 10 decimal places behind the decimal point.


Problem 395

The Pythagorean tree is a fractal generated by the following procedure:


Start with a unit square. Then, calling one of the sides its base (in
 the animation, the bottom side is the base): Attach a right triangle to
 the side opposite the base, with the hypotenuse coinciding with that
 side and with the sides in a 3-4-5 ratio. Note that the smaller side
 of the triangle must be on the 'right' side with respect to the base
 (see animation).  Attach a square to each leg of the right triangle, with
 one of its sides coinciding with that leg.  Repeat this procedure for
 both squares, considering as their bases the sides touching the triangle.

The resulting figure, after an infinite number of iterations, is the
 Pythagorean tree.




It can be shown that there exists at least one rectangle, whose sides are
 parallel to the largest square of the Pythagorean tree, which encloses
 the Pythagorean tree completely.


Find the smallest area possible for such a bounding rectangle, and give
 your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.


Problem 396

For any positive integer n, the nth weak Goodstein sequence {g1, g2, g3,
 ...} is defined as: g1 = n for k > 1, gk is obtained by writing gk-1
 in base k, interpreting it as a base k + 1 number, and subtracting 1.

The sequence terminates when gk becomes 0.


For example, the 6th weak Goodstein sequence is {6, 11, 17, 25, ...}:
 g1 = 6.  g2 = 11 since 6 = 1102, 1103 = 12, and 12 - 1 = 11.  g3 =
 17 since 11 = 1023, 1024 = 18, and 18 - 1 = 17.  g4 = 25 since 17 =
 1014, 1015 = 26, and 26 - 1 = 25.

and so on.


It can be shown that every weak Goodstein sequence terminates.


Let G(n) be the number of nonzero elements in the nth weak Goodstein
 sequence.
It can be verified that G(2) = 3, G(4) = 21 and G(6) = 381.

Problem 398

Inside a rope of length n, n-1 points are placed with distance 1 from
 each other and from the endpoints. Among these points, we choose m-1
 points at random and cut the rope at these points to create m segments.


Let E(n, m) be the expected length of the second-shortest segment.
For example, E(3, 2) = 2 and E(8, 3) = 16/7.
Note that if multiple segments have the same shortest length the length
 of the second-shortest segment is defined as the same as the shortest
 length.

Problem 399

The first 15 fibonacci numbers are:
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610.
It can be seen that 8 and 144 are not squarefree: 8 is divisible by 4
 and 144 is divisible by 4 and by 9.
So the first 13 squarefree fibonacci numbers are:
1,1,2,3,5,13,21,34,55,89,233,377 and 610.


The 200th squarefree fibonacci number is:
971183874599339129547649988289594072811608739584170445.
The last sixteen digits of this number are: 1608739584170445 and in
 scientific notation this number can be written as 9.7e53.


Find the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci number.
Give as your answer its last sixteen digits followed by a comma followed
 by the number in scientific notation (rounded to one digit after the
 decimal point).
For the 200th squarefree number the answer would have been:
 1608739584170445,9.7e53



Note:
For this problem, assume that for every prime p, the first fibonacci
 number divisible by p is not divisible by p2 (this is part of Wall's
 conjecture). This has been verified for primes ≤ 3·1015, but has
 not been proven in general.

If it happens that the conjecture is false, then the accepted answer
 to this problem isn't guaranteed to be the 100 000 000th squarefree
 fibonacci number, rather it represents only a lower bound for that
 number.



Problem 400

A Fibonacci tree is a binary tree recursively defined as:T(0) is the
 empty tree.
T(1) is the binary tree with only one node.
T(k) consists of a root node that has T(k-1) and T(k-2) as children.

On such a tree two players play a take-away game. On each turn a player
 selects a node and removes that node along with the subtree rooted at
 that node.
The player who is forced to take the root node of the entire tree loses.

Here are the winning moves of the first player on the first turn for T(k)
 from k=1 to k=6.

 moves for which the second player has no winning strategy) on the first
 turn of the game when this game is played on T(k).

Problem 406
We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers
 {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions.
Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:
 "Your guess is lower than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of
 a), or "Your guess is higher than the hidden number" (and you incur a
 cost of b), or "Yes, that's it!" (and the game ends).
Given the value of n, a, and b, an optimal strategy minimizes the total
 cost for the worst possible case.
For example, if n = 5, a = 2, and b = 3, then we may begin by asking
 "2" as our first question.
If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of
 b=3), then we are sure that "1" is the hidden number (for a total cost
 of 3).
If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2),
 then our next question will be "4".
If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of
 b=3), then we are sure that "3" is the hidden number (for a total cost
 of 2+3=5).
If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of
 a=2), then we are sure that "5" is the hidden number (for a total cost
 of 2+2=4).
Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is 5. It can also
 be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved.
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given
 values of n, a, and b.
Let $C(n, a, b)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy
 for the given values of n, a and b.
Here are a few examples:
$C(5, 2, 3) = 5$
$C(500, \sqrt 2, \sqrt 3) = 13.22073197\dots$
$C(20000, 5, 7) = 82$

 rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.

 strategy). For example, W(1) = 1, W(2) = 6, W(3) = 168, W(5) = 19764360

 this property.
Let F(R, X) be the number of the integer quadruplets (r, a, b, c) with
 this property, and with 0 < r ≤ R and 0 < a ≤ X.

Problem 411

Let n be a positive integer. Suppose there are stations at the coordinates
 (x, y) = (2i mod n, 3i mod n) for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2n. We will consider
 stations with the same coordinates as the same station.

We wish to form a path from (0, 0) to (n, n) such that the x and y
 coordinates never decrease.
Let S(n) be the maximum number of stations such a path can pass through.

For example, if n = 22, there are 11 distinct stations, and a valid path
 can pass through at most 5 stations. Therefore, S(22) = 5.
The case is illustrated below, with an example of an optimal path:



It can also be verified that S(123) = 14 and S(10000) = 48.

Find ∑ S(k5) for 1 ≤ k ≤ 30.


Problem 412
For integers m, n (0 ≤ n < m), let L(m, n) be an m×m grid with
 the top-right n×n grid removed.
For example, L(5, 3) looks like this:

We want to number each cell of L(m, n) with consecutive integers 1, 2,
 3, ... such that the number in every cell is smaller than the number
 below it and to the left of it.
For example, here are two valid numberings of L(5, 3):

Let LC(m, n) be the number of valid numberings of L(m, n).
It can be verified that LC(3, 0) = 42, LC(5, 3) = 250250, LC(6, 3)
 = 406029023400 and LC(10, 5) mod 76543217 = 61251715.
Find LC(10000, 5000) mod 76543217.

Problem 413
We say that a d-digit positive number (no leading zeros) is a one-child
 number if exactly one of its sub-strings is divisible by d.
For example, 5671 is a 4-digit one-child number. Among all its sub-strings
 5, 6, 7, 1, 56, 67, 71, 567, 671 and 5671, only 56 is divisible by 4.
Similarly, 104 is a 3-digit one-child number because only 0 is divisible
 by 3.
1132451 is a 7-digit one-child number because only 245 is divisible by 7.
Let F(N) be the number of the one-child numbers less than N.
We can verify that F(10) = 9, F(103) = 389 and F(107) = 277674.
Find F(1019).

Problem 414

6174 is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order
 and subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the
 digits in decreasing order, we get 7641-1467=6174.
Even more remarkable is that if we start from any 4 digit number and
 repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end
 up with 6174 or immediately with 0 if all digits are equal.
This also works with numbers that have less than 4 digits if we pad the
 number with leading zeroes until we have 4 digits.
E.g. let's start with the number 0837:
8730-0378=8352
8532-2358=6174


6174 is called the Kaprekar constant. The process of sorting and
 subtracting and repeating this until either 0 or the Kaprekar constant
 is reached is called the Kaprekar routine.


We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits.
Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all
 cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers
 or the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different
 input numbers.
However, it can be shown that for 5 digits and a base b = 6t+3≠9,
 a Kaprekar constant exists.
E.g. base 15: (10,4,14,9,5)15
base 21: (14,6,20,13,7)21

Define Cb to be the Kaprekar constant in base b for 5 digits.
Define the function sb(i) to be 0 if i = Cb or if i written in base b
 consists of 5 identical digits the number of iterations it takes the
 Kaprekar routine in base b to arrive at Cb, otherwise

Note that we can define sb(i) for all integers i < b5. If i written in
 base b takes less than 5 digits, the number is padded with leading zero
 digits until we have 5 digits before applying the Kaprekar routine.


Define S(b) as the sum of sb(i) for 0 < i < b5.
E.g. S(15) = 5274369
S(111) = 400668930299


Find the sum of S(6k+3) for 2 ≤ k ≤ 300.
Give the last 18 digits as your answer.


Problem 415
A set of lattice points S is called a titanic set if there exists a line
 passing through exactly two points in S.
An example of a titanic set is S = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1),
 (2, 0), (1, 0)}, where the line passing through (0, 1) and (2, 0)
 does not pass through any other point in S.
On the other hand, the set {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)} is not a
 titanic set since the line passing through any two points in the set
 also passes through the other two.
For any positive integer N, let T(N) be the number of titanic sets S
 whose every point (x, y) satisfies 0 ≤ x, y ≤ N.
It can be verified that T(1) = 11, T(2) = 494, T(4) = 33554178, T(111)
 mod 108 = 13500401 and T(105) mod 108 = 63259062.
Find T(1011) mod 108.

Problem 416
A row of n squares contains a frog in the leftmost square. By successive
 jumps the frog goes to the rightmost square and then back to the
 leftmost square. On the outward trip he jumps one, two or three squares
 to the right, and on the homeward trip he jumps to the left in a similar
 manner. He cannot jump outside the squares. He repeats the round-trip
 travel m times.
Let F(m, n) be the number of the ways the frog can travel so that at
 most one square remains unvisited.
For example, F(1, 3) = 4, F(1, 4) = 15, F(1, 5) = 46, F(2, 3) = 16 and
 F(2, 100) mod 109 = 429619151.
Find the last 9 digits of F(10, 1012).

Problem 417
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation
 of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

1/2= 0.5
1/3= 0.(3)
1/4= 0.25
1/5= 0.2
1/6= 0.1(6)
1/7= 0.(142857)
1/8= 0.125
1/9= 0.(1)
1/10= 0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It
 can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than 2 and/or
 5 are not considered to have a recurring cycle.
We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as 0.


Let L(n) denote the length of the recurring cycle of 1/n.
You are given that ∑ L(n) for 3 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000 equals
 55535191115.


Find ∑ L(n) for 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 000.

Problem 418

Let n be a positive integer. An integer triple (a, b, c) is called a
 factorisation triple of n if: 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c a·b·c = n.

Define f(n) to be a + b + c for the factorisation triple (a, b, c)
 of n which minimises c / a. One can show that this triple is unique.


For example, f(165) = 19, f(100100) = 142 and f(20!) = 4034872.


Find f(43!).


Problem 419

The look and say sequence goes 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221,
 1113213211, ...
The sequence starts with 1 and all other members are obtained by
 describing the previous member in terms of consecutive digits.
It helps to do this out loud:
1 is 'one one' → 11
11 is 'two ones' → 21
21 is 'one two and one one' → 1211
1211 is 'one one, one two and two ones' → 111221
111221 is 'three ones, two twos and one one' → 312211
...


Define A(n), B(n) and C(n) as the number of ones, twos and threes in
 the n'th element of the sequence respectively.
One can verify that A(40) = 31254, B(40) = 20259 and C(40) = 11625.


Find A(n), B(n) and C(n) for n = 1012.
Give your answer modulo 230 and separate your values for A, B and C by
 a comma.
E.g. for n = 40 the answer would be 31254,20259,11625


Problem 420
A positive integer matrix is a matrix whose elements are all positive
 integers.
Some positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a positive
 integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
40 & 12\\
48 & 40
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 3\\
12 & 2
\end{pmatrix}^2 =
\begin{pmatrix}
6 & 1\\
4 & 6
\end{pmatrix}^2
$$


We define F(N) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which
 have a trace less than N and which can be expressed as a square of a
 positive integer matrix in two different ways.
We can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.


Find F(107).


Problem 421

Numbers of the form n15+1 are composite for every integer n > 1.
For positive integers n and m let s(n,m) be defined as the sum of the
 distinct prime factors of n15+1 not exceeding m.

E.g. 215+1 = 3×3×11×331.
So s(2,10) = 3 and s(2,1000) = 3+11+331 = 345.

Also 1015+1 = 7×11×13×211×241×2161×9091.
So s(10,100) = 31 and s(10,1000) = 483.
Find ∑ s(n,108) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 1011.


Problem 422
Let H be the hyperbola defined by the equation 12x2 + 7xy - 12y2 = 625.
Next, define X as the point (7, 1). It can be seen that X is in H.
Now we define a sequence of points in H, {Pi : i ≥ 1}, as: P1 =
 (13, 61/4).  P2 = (-43/6, -4).  For i > 2, Pi is the unique point in
 H that is different from Pi-1 and such that line PiPi-1 is parallel
 to line Pi-2X. It can be shown that Pi is well-defined, and that its
 coordinates are always rational.

You are given that P3  = (-19/2, -229/24), P4 = (1267/144, -37/12)
 and P7 = (17194218091/143327232, 274748766781/1719926784).
Find Pn for n = 1114 in the following format:If Pn = (a/b, c/d) where
 the fractions are in lowest terms and the denominators are positive,
 then the answer is (a + b + c + d) mod 1 000 000 007.
For n = 7, the answer would have been: 806236837.

Problem 423
Let n be a positive integer.
A 6-sided die is thrown n times. Let c be the number of pairs of
 consecutive throws that give the same value.
For example, if n = 7 and the values of the die throws are
 (1,1,5,6,6,6,3), then the following pairs of consecutive throws give
 the same value:
(1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
(1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
(1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
Therefore, c = 3 for (1,1,5,6,6,6,3).
Define C(n) as the number of outcomes of throwing a 6-sided die n times
 such that c does not exceed π(n).1
For example, C(3) = 216, C(4) = 1290, C(11) = 361912500 and C(24) =
 4727547363281250000.
Define S(L) as ∑ C(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ L.
For example, S(50) mod 1 000 000 007 = 832833871.
Find S(50 000 000) mod 1 000 000 007.  1 π denotes the
 prime-counting function, i.e. π(n) is the number of primes ≤ n.

Problem 424

The above is an example of a cryptic kakuro (also known as cross sums,
 or even sums cross) puzzle, with its final solution on the right. (The
 common rules of kakuro puzzles can be found easily on numerous
 internet sites. Other related information can also be currently found
 at krazydad.com whose author has provided the puzzle data for this
 challenge.)
The downloadable text file (kakuro200.txt) contains the description of
 200 such puzzles, a mix of 5x5 and 6x6 types. The first puzzle in the
 file is the above example which is coded as follows:
6,X,X,(vCC),(vI),X,X,X,(hH),B,O,(vCA),(vJE),X,(hFE,vD),O,O,O,O,(hA),O,I,(hJC,vB),O,O,(hJC),H,O,O,O,X,X,X,(hJE),O,O,X
The first character is a numerical digit indicating the size of the
 information grid. It would be either a 6 (for a 5x5 kakuro puzzle)
 or a 7 (for a 6x6 puzzle) followed by a comma (,). The extra top line
 and left column are needed to insert information.
The content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma,
 going left to right and starting with the top line.
X = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.
O (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.
A = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by
 its equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.
( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded
 by a lower case "h" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case
 "v". Those are followed by one or two upper case letters depending if
 the sum is a single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums,
 the first letter would be for the "tens" and the second one for the
 "units". When the cell must contain information for both a horizontal
 and a vertical sum, the first one is always for the horizontal sum and
 the two are separated by a comma within the same set of brackets, ex.:
 (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets is also immediately followed by a comma.
The description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line
 Feed (CRLF) instead of a comma.
The required answer to each puzzle is based on the value of each letter
 necessary to arrive at the solution and according to the alphabetical
 order. As indicated under the example puzzle, its answer would be
 8426039571. At least 9 out of the 10 encrypting letters are always part
 of the problem description. When only 9 are given, the missing one must
 be assigned the remaining digit.
You are given that the sum of the answers for the first 10 puzzles in
 the file is 64414157580.
Find the sum of the answers for the 200 puzzles.

Problem 425

Two positive numbers A and B are said to be connected (denoted by "A
 ↔ B") if one of these conditions holds:
(1) A and B have the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for
 example, 123 ↔ 173.
(2) Adding one digit to the left of A (or B) makes B (or A); for example,
 23 ↔ 223 and 123 ↔ 23.


We call a prime P a 2's relative if there exists a chain of connected
 primes between 2 and P and no prime in the chain exceeds P.


For example, 127 is a 2's relative. One of the possible chains is
 shown below:
2 ↔ 3 ↔ 13 ↔ 113 ↔ 103 ↔ 107 ↔ 127
However, 11 and 103 are not 2's relatives.


Let F(N) be the sum of the primes ≤ N which are not 2's relatives.
We can verify that F(103) = 431 and F(104) = 78728.


Find F(107).


Problem 426

Consider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For
 example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes
 followed by 2 empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied
 boxes can be denoted by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the
 number of consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear alternately.


A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the
 following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to
 the nearest empty box to its right.


After one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3)
 as can be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at
 the first occupied box.




A system like this is called a Box-Ball System or BBS for short.


It can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system
 evolves to a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is
 invariant. In the example below, the consecutive numbers of occupied
 boxes evolves to [1, 2, 3]; we shall call this the final state.




We define the sequence {ti}:s0 = 290797
sk+1 = sk2 mod 50515093
tk = (sk mod 64) + 1

Starting from the initial configuration (t0, t1, …, t10), the final
 state becomes [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].
Starting from the initial configuration (t0, t1, …, t10 000 000),
 find the final state.
Give as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final
 state. For example, if the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 12 +
 22 + 32) is your answer.


Problem 427
A sequence of integers S = {si} is called an n-sequence if it has n
 elements and each element si satisfies 1 ≤ si ≤ n. Thus there are
 nn distinct n-sequences in total.
For example, the sequence S = {1, 5, 5, 10, 7, 7, 7, 2, 3, 7} is a
 10-sequence.
For any sequence S, let L(S) be the length of the longest contiguous
 subsequence of S with the same value.
For example, for the given sequence S above, L(S) = 3, because of the
 three consecutive 7's.
Let f(n) = ∑ L(S) for all n-sequences S.
For example, f(3) = 45, f(7) = 1403689 and f(11) = 481496895121.
Find f(7 500 000) mod 1 000 000 009.

Problem 428
Let a, b and c be positive numbers.
Let W, X, Y, Z be four collinear points where |WX| = a, |XY| = b, |YZ|
 = c and |WZ| = a + b + c.
Let Cin be the circle having the diameter XY.
Let Cout be the circle having the diameter WZ.

The triplet (a, b, c) is called a necklace triplet if you can place k
 ≥ 3 distinct circles C1, C2, ..., Ck such that:
Ci has no common interior points with any Cj for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k and
 i ≠ j,
Ci is tangent to both Cin and Cout for 1 ≤ i ≤ k,
Ci is tangent to Ci+1 for 1 ≤ i < k, and
Ck is tangent to C1.

For example, (5, 5, 5) and (4, 3, 21) are necklace triplets, while it
 can be shown that (2, 2, 5) is not.



Let T(n) be the number of necklace triplets (a, b, c) such that a,
 b and c are positive integers, and b ≤ n.
For example, T(1) = 9, T(20) = 732 and T(3000) = 438106.


Find T(1 000 000 000).


Problem 429

A unitary divisor d of a number n is a divisor of n that has the property
 gcd(d, n/d) = 1.
The unitary divisors of 4! = 24 are 1, 3, 8 and 24.
The sum of their squares is 12 + 32 + 82 + 242 = 650.


Let S(n) represent the sum of the squares of the unitary divisors of
 n. Thus S(4!)=650.


Find S(100 000 000!) modulo 1 000 000 009.


Problem 430
N disks are placed in a row, indexed 1 to N from left to right.
Each disk has a black side and white side. Initially all disks show
 their white side.
At each turn, two, not necessarily distinct, integers A and B between
 1 and N (inclusive) are chosen uniformly at random.
All disks with an index from A to B (inclusive) are flipped.
The following example shows the case N = 8. At the first turn A = 5 and
 B = 2, and at the second turn A = 4 and B = 6.

Let E(N, M) be the expected number of disks that show their white side
 after M turns.
We can verify that E(3, 1) = 10/9, E(3, 2) = 5/3, E(10, 4) ≈ 5.157
 and E(100, 10) ≈ 51.893.
Find E(1010, 4000).
Give your answer rounded to 2 decimal places behind the decimal point.

Problem 431
Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm
 and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated
 when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative
 from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only
 manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on
 a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from
 his property.
Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are
 delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle
 made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example
 if the angle of repose, $\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered
 at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the
 top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter
 of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556
 m3. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a
 horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a
 strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.


We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by
 $V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared
 decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \approx
 36$. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is
 exactly one other option: $V(2.511167869) \approx 49$. It would be like
 knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory
 on top of your grain.
Fred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on
 closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness
 turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's
 the radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the
 angle of repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can
 find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more
 than happy to keep it.
If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the
 farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$
 for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\sum x$
 correct to 9 decimal places.

Let S(n,m) = ∑φ(n × i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ m. (φ is Euler's totient

Let E(x0, y0) be the number of steps it takes to determine the greatest
 common divisor of x0 and y0 with Euclid's algorithm. More formally:x1 =
 y0, y1 = x0 mod y0xn = yn-1, yn = xn-1 mod yn-1
E(x0, y0) is the smallest n such that yn = 0.


We have E(1,1) = 1, E(10,6) = 3 and E(6,10) = 4.


Define S(N) as the sum of E(x,y) for 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.
We have S(1) = 1, S(10) = 221 and S(100) = 39826.


Find S(5·106).


Problem 434
Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the
 vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.
Graphs can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex
 with a point in the Euclidean space.
A flexible graph is an embedding of a graph where it is possible to move
 one or more vertices continuously so that the distance between at least
 two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between each
 pair of adjacent vertices is kept constant.
A rigid graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.
Informally, a graph is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully
 rotating hinges and the edges with rods that are unbending and inelastic,
 no parts of the graph can be moved independently from the rest of
 the graph.

The grid graphs embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as the
 following animation demonstrates:

However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the
 cells. For example, for the 2x3 grid graph, there are 19 ways to make
 the graph rigid:

Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing
 the orientation of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a
 cell as a different way of making a grid graph rigid.

Let R(m,n) be the number of ways to make the m × n grid graph rigid.
E.g. R(2,3) = 19 and R(5,5) = 23679901

Define S(N) as ∑ R(i,j) for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N.
E.g. S(5) = 25021721.

Problem 435
The Fibonacci numbers $\{f_n, n \ge 0\}$ are defined recursively as $f_n =
 f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ with base cases $f_0 = 0$ and $f_1 = 1$.
Define the polynomials $\{F_n, n \ge 0\}$ as $F_n(x) =

Problem 436
Julie proposes the following wager to her sister Louise.
She suggests they play a game of chance to determine who will wash
 the dishes.
For this game, they shall use a generator of independent random numbers
 uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
The game starts with S = 0.
The first player, Louise, adds to S different random numbers from the
 generator until S > 1 and records her last random number 'x'.
The second player, Julie, continues adding to S different random numbers
 from the generator until S > 2 and records her last random number 'y'.
The player with the highest number wins and the loser washes the dishes,
 i.e. if y > x the second player wins.
For example, if the first player draws 0.62 and 0.44, the first player
 turn ends since 0.62+0.44 > 1 and x = 0.44.
If the second players draws 0.1, 0.27 and 0.91, the second player turn
 ends since 0.62+0.44+0.1+0.27+0.91 > 2 and y = 0.91.
Since y > x, the second player wins.
Louise thinks about it for a second, and objects: "That's not fair".
What is the probability that the second player wins?

Problem 437

When we calculate 8n modulo 11 for n=0 to 9 we get: 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10,
 3, 2, 5, 7.
As we see all possible values from 1 to 10 occur. So 8 is a primitive
 root of 11.
But there is more:
If we take a closer look we see:
1+8=9
8+9=17≡6 mod 11
9+6=15≡4 mod 11
6+4=10
4+10=14≡3 mod 11
10+3=13≡2 mod 11
3+2=5
2+5=7
5+7=12≡1 mod 11.

So the powers of 8 mod 11 are cyclic with period 10, and 8n + 8n+1 ≡
 8n+2 (mod 11).
8 is called a Fibonacci primitive root of 11.
Not every prime has a Fibonacci primitive root.
There are 323 primes less than 10000 with one or more Fibonacci primitive
 roots and the sum of these primes is 1480491.
Find the sum of the primes less than 100,000,000 with at least one
 Fibonacci primitive root.



Problem 438

For an n-tuple of integers t = (a1, ..., an), let (x1, ..., xn) be
 the solutions of the polynomial equation xn + a1xn-1 + a2xn-2 + ... +
 an-1x + an = 0.

Problem 444
A group of $p$ people decide to sit down at a round table and play
   a lottery-ticket trading game. Each person starts off with a
   randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when
   scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from £1 to
   £$p$, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for all
   of the players to maximize the winnings of the ticket they hold upon
   leaving the game.
An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the
   table, each player has only one of two options:
The player can choose to scratch the ticket and reveal its worth to
   everyone at the table.
If the player's ticket is unscratched, then the player may trade it with
   a previous player's scratched ticket, and then leaves the game with
   that ticket. The previous player then scratches the newly-acquired
   ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table.
The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still
   remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.
Assume that players will use the optimal strategy for maximizing the
   expected value of their ticket winnings.
Let $E(p)$ represent the expected number of players left at the table
   when the game ends in a game consisting of $p$ players.
E.g. $E(111) = 5.2912$ when rounded to 5 significant digits.
Let $S_1(N) = \sum \limits_{p = 1}^{N} {E(p)}$.
Let $S_k(N) = \sum \limits_{p = 1}^{N} {S_{k-1}(p)}$ for $k \gt 1$.

   rounded to 10 significant digits. Use a lowercase e to separate
   mantissa and exponent. For example, the answer for $S_3(100)$ would

Problem 460

On the Euclidean plane, an ant travels from point A(0, 1) to point B(d,
   1) for an integer d.


In each step, the ant at point (x0, y0) chooses one of the lattice points
 (x1, y1) which satisfy x1 ≥ 0 and y1 ≥ 1 and goes straight to
 (x1, y1) at a constant velocity v. The value of v depends on y0 and
 y1 as follows: If y0 = y1, the value of v equals y0.  If y0 ≠ y1,
 the value of v equals (y1 - y0) / (ln(y1) - ln(y0)).

The left image is one of the possible paths for d = 4. First the ant
 goes from A(0, 1) to P1(1, 3) at velocity (3 - 1) / (ln(3) - ln(1))
 ≈ 1.8205. Then the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.
From P1(1, 3) to P2(3, 3) the ant travels at velocity 3 so the required
 time is 2 / 3 ≈ 0.6667. From P2(3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant travels at
 velocity (1 - 3) / (ln(1) - ln(3)) ≈ 1.8205 so the required time is
 sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.
Thus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.


The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated
 as 0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052. It can be shown that this is the
 quickest path for d = 4.



Let F(d) be the total required time if the ant chooses the quickest
 path. For example, F(4) ≈ 2.960516287.
We can verify that F(10) ≈ 4.668187834 and F(100) ≈ 9.217221972.

This is one of the possible permutations for N = 20.
- 1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, 16, 6, 18, 12.
This is not a valid permutation because 12 comes before its divisor 6.
- 1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, 12, 16, 6, 18.

Problem 465
The kernel of a polygon is defined by the set of points from which the
 entire polygon's boundary is visible. We define a polar polygon as a
 polygon for which the origin is strictly contained inside its kernel.
For this problem, a polygon can have collinear consecutive
 vertices. However, a polygon still cannot have self-intersection and
 cannot have zero area.
For example, only the first of the following is a polar polygon (the
 kernels of the second, third, and fourth do not strictly contain the
 origin, and the fifth does not have a kernel at all):

Notice that the first polygon has three consecutive collinear vertices.
Let P(n) be the number of polar polygons such that the vertices (x, y)
 have integer coordinates whose absolute values are not greater than n.
Note that polygons should be counted as different if they have different
 set of edges, even if they enclose the same area. For example, the
 polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0)] is distinct from the
 polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0),(1,0)].
For example, P(1) = 131, P(2) = 1648531, P(3) = 1099461296175 and P(343)
 mod 1 000 000 007 = 937293740.
Find P(713) mod 1 000 000 007.

Problem 466
Let P(m,n) be the number of distinct terms in an m×n multiplication
 table.
For example, a 3×4 multiplication table looks like this:
× 12341 12342 24683 36912
There are 8 distinct terms {1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12}, therefore P(3,4) = 8.
You are given that:
P(64,64) = 1263,
P(12,345) = 1998, and
P(32,1015) = 13826382602124302.
Find P(64,1016).

Problem 467
An integer s is called a superinteger of another integer n if the digits
 of n form a subsequence of the digits of s.
For example, 2718281828 is a superinteger of 18828, while 314159 is not
 a superinteger of 151.

Let p(n) be the nth prime number, and let c(n) be the nth composite
 number. For example, p(1) = 2, p(10) = 29, c(1) = 4 and c(10) = 18.
{p(i) : i ≥ 1} = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...}
{c(i) : i ≥ 1} = {4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, ...}
Let PD the sequence of the digital roots of {p(i)} (CD is defined
 similarly for {c(i)}):
PD = {2, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 8, 1, 5, 2, ...}
CD = {4, 6, 8, 9, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, ...}
Let Pn be the integer formed by concatenating the first n elements of PD
 (Cn is defined similarly for CD).
P10 = 2357248152
C10 = 4689135679
Let f(n) be the smallest positive integer that is a common superinteger
 of Pn and Cn. For example, f(10) = 2357246891352679, and f(100) mod
 1 000 000 007 = 771661825.
Find f(10 000) mod 1 000 000 007.

Problem 468
An integer is called B-smooth if none of its prime factors is greater
 than $B$.
Let $S_B(n)$ be the largest $B$-smooth divisor of $n$.
Examples:
$S_1(10)=1$
$S_4(2100) = 12$
$S_{17}(2496144) = 5712$
Define $\displaystyle F(n)=\sum_{B=1}^n \sum_{r=0}^n S_B(\binom n
 r)$. Here, $\displaystyle \binom n r$ denotes the binomial coefficient.
Examples:
$F(11) = 3132$
$F(1111) \mod 1\,000\,000\,993 = 706036312$
$F(111\,111) \mod 1\,000\,000\,993 = 22156169$
Find $F(11\,111\,111)  \mod 1\,000\,000\,993$.

Problem 469

In a room N chairs are placed around a round table.
Knights enter the room one by one and choose at random an available
 empty chair.
To have enough elbow room the knights always leave at least one empty
 chair between each other.


When there aren't any suitable chairs left, the fraction C of empty
 chairs is determined.
We also define E(N) as the expected value of C.
We can verify that E(4) = 1/2 and E(6) = 5/9.

 the form 0.abcdefghijklmn.


Problem 470
Consider a single game of Ramvok:
Let t represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If t = 0,
 then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn i, the player
 rolls a die. After rolling, if i < t the player can either stop the
 game and receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or
 discard the roll and try again next turn. If i = t, then the roll cannot
 be discarded and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins,
 t is chosen by the player, who must then pay an up-front cost ct for
 some constant c. For c = 0, t can be chosen to be infinite (with an
 up-front cost of 0). Let R(d, c) be the expected profit (i.e. net gain)
 that the player receives from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok,
 given a fair d-sided die and cost constant c. For example, R(4, 0.2)
 = 2.65. Assume that the player has sufficient funds for paying any/all
 up-front costs.
Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:
In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a
 slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration
 process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face
 has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If
 the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original
 value. After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin
 (and during such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face
 with a value on it appears). The player knows which faces are blank
 and which are not at all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all
 faces of the die are blank.
Let S(d, c) be the expected profit that the player receives from an
 optimally-played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die to start
 (with all sides visible), and cost constant c. For example, S(6, 1)
 = 208.3.
Let F(n) = ∑ 4≤d≤n∑ 0≤c≤n S(d, c).
Calculate F(20), rounded to the nearest integer.

Problem 471
The triangle ΔABC is inscribed in an ellipse with equation $\frac {x^2}
 {a^2} + \frac {y^2} {b^2} = 1$, 0 < 2b < a, a and b integers.
Let r(a,b) be the radius of the incircle of ΔABC when the incircle has
 center (2b, 0) and A has coordinates $\left( \frac a 2, \frac {\sqrt 3}
 2 b\right)$.
For example, r(3,1) = ½, r(6,2) = 1, r(12,3) = 2.

Give your answer in scientific notation rounded to 10 significant
 digits. Use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent.
For G(10) the answer would have been 2.059722222e1.

Problem 472
There are N seats in a row. N people come one after another to fill the
 seats according to the following rules:
No person sits beside another.
The first person chooses any seat.
Each subsequent person chooses the seat furthest from anyone else already
 seated, as long as it does not violate rule 1. If there is more than
 one choice satisfying this condition, then the person chooses the
 leftmost choice.
Note that due to rule 1, some seats will surely be left unoccupied,
 and the maximum number of people that can be seated is less than N
 (for N > 1).
Here are the possible seating arrangements for N = 15:

We see that if the first person chooses correctly, the 15 seats can seat
 up to 7 people.
We can also see that the first person has 9 choices to maximize the
 number of people that may be seated.
Let f(N) be the number of choices the first person has to maximize the
 number of occupants for N seats in a row. Thus, f(1) = 1, f(15) = 9,
 f(20) = 6, and f(500) = 16.
Also, ∑ f(N) = 83 for 1 ≤ N ≤ 20 and  ∑ f(N) = 13343
 for 1 ≤ N ≤ 500.
Find ∑ f(N) for 1 ≤ N ≤ 1012. Give the last 8 digits of
 your answer.

Problem 473

Let $\varphi$ be the golden ratio: $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.$
Remarkably it is possible to write every positive integer as a sum of
 powers of $\varphi$ even if we require that every power of $\varphi$
 is used at most once in this sum.
Even then this representation is not unique.
We can make it unique by requiring that no powers with consecutive
 exponents are used and that the representation is finite.
E.g:
$2=\varphi+\varphi^{-2}$ and $3=\varphi^{2}+\varphi^{-2}$


To represent this sum of powers of $\varphi$ we use a string of 0's and
 1's with a point to indicate where the negative exponents start.
We call this the representation in the phigital numberbase.
So $1=1_{\varphi}$, $2=10.01_{\varphi}$, $3=100.01_{\varphi}$ and
 $14=100100.001001_{\varphi}$.
The strings representing 1, 2 and 14 in the phigital number base are
 palindromic, while the string representing 3 is not. (the phigital
 point is not the middle character).


The sum of the positive integers not exceeding 1000 whose phigital
 representation is palindromic is 4345.


Find the sum of the positive integers not exceeding $10^{10}$ whose
 phigital representation is palindromic.

Problem 474

For a positive integer n and digits d, we define F(n, d) as the number
 of the divisors of n whose last digits equal d.
For example, F(84, 4) = 3. Among the divisors of 84 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7,
 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84), three of them (4, 14, 84) have the last digit 4.


We can also verify that F(12!, 12) = 11 and F(50!, 123) = 17888.


Find F(106!, 65432) modulo (1016 + 61).


Problem 475
12n musicians participate at a music festival. On the first day, they
 form 3n quartets and practice all day.
It is a disaster. At the end of the day, all musicians decide they will
 never again agree to play with any member of their quartet.
On the second day, they form 4n trios, with every musician avoiding any
 previous quartet partners.

Problem 477
The number sequence game starts with a sequence S of N numbers written
 on a line.
Two players alternate turns. The players on their respective turns must
 select and remove either the first or the last number remaining in
 the sequence.
A player's own score is (determined by) the sum of all the numbers that
 player has taken. Each player attempts to maximize their own sum.
If N = 4 and S = {1, 2, 10, 3}, then each player maximizes their own
 score as follows:
Player 1: removes the first number (1)
Player 2: removes the last number from the remaining sequence (3)
Player 1: removes the last number from the remaining sequence (10)
Player 2: removes the remaining number (2)
Player 1 score is 1 + 10 = 11.
Let F(N) be the score of player 1 if both players follow the optimal
 strategy for the sequence S = {s1, s2, ..., sN} defined as:
s1 = 0
si+1 = (si2 + 45) modulo 1 000 000 007
The sequence begins with
 S = {0, 45, 2070, 4284945, 753524550, 478107844, 894218625, ...}.
You are given F(2) = 45, F(4) = 4284990, F(100) = 26365463243,
 F(104) = 2495838522951.
Find F(108).

Problem 478
Let us consider mixtures of three substances: A, B and C. A mixture
 can be described by a ratio of the amounts of A, B, and C in it,
 i.e., (a : b : c). For example, a mixture described by the ratio
 (2 : 3 : 5) contains 20% A, 30% B and 50% C.
For the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual
 components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts
 of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.
For example, say we have three mixtures with ratios (3 : 0 : 2),
 (3 : 6 : 11) and (3 : 3 : 4). By mixing 10 units of the first,
 20 units of the second and 30 units of the third, we get a new mixture
 with ratio (6 : 5 : 9), since:
(10·3/5 + 20·3/20 + 30·3/10 : 10·0/5 + 20·6/20 + 30·3/10 : 10·2/5 + 20·11/20 + 30·4/10)
= (18 : 15 : 27) = (6 : 5 : 9)
However, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the ratio
 (3 : 2 : 1), since the amount of B is always less than the amount
 of C.
Let n be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of integers (a,
 b, c) with 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ n and gcd(a, b, c) = 1, we have a mixture
 with ratio (a : b : c). Let M(n) be the set of all such mixtures.
For example, M(2) contains the 19 mixtures with the following ratios:
{(0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0), (0 : 1 : 1), (0 : 1 : 2),
 (0 : 2 : 1),
(1 : 0 : 0), (1 : 0 : 1), (1 : 0 : 2), (1 : 1 : 0),
 (1 : 1 : 1),
(1 : 1 : 2), (1 : 2 : 0), (1 : 2 : 1), (1 : 2 : 2),
 (2 : 0 : 1),
(2 : 1 : 0), (2 : 1 : 1), (2 : 1 : 2), (2 : 2 : 1)}.
Let E(n) be the number of subsets of M(n) which can produce the mixture
 with ratio (1 : 1 : 1), i.e., the mixture with equal parts A, B and C.
We can verify that E(1) = 103, E(2) = 520447, E(10) mod 118 = 82608406
 and E(500) mod 118 = 13801403.
Find E(10 000 000) mod 118.

Problem 479
Let $a_k$, $b_k$, and $c_k$ represent the three solutions (real or
 complex numbers) to the equation
$\frac 1 x = (\frac k x)^2(k+x^2)-k x$.
For instance, for $k=5$, we see that $\{a_5, b_5, c_5 \}$ is approximately
 $\{5.727244, -0.363622+2.057397i, -0.363622-2.057397i\}$.
Let $\displaystyle S(n) =
 \sum_{p=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^n(a_k+b_k)^p(b_k+c_k)^p(c_k+a_k)^p$.
Interestingly, $S(n)$ is always an integer. For example, $S(4) = 51160$.
Find $S(10^6)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 481
A group of chefs (numbered #1, #2, etc) participate in a turn-based
 strategic cooking competition. On each chef's turn, he/she cooks up a
 dish to the best of his/her ability and gives it to a separate panel
 of judges for taste-testing. Let S(k) represent chef #k's skill level
 (which is publicly known). More specifically, S(k) is the probability
 that chef #k's dish will be assessed favorably by the judges (on any/all
 turns). If the dish receives a favorable rating, then the chef must
 choose one other chef to be eliminated from the competition. The last
 chef remaining in the competition is the winner.
The game always begins with chef #1, with the turn order iterating
 sequentially over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle
 repeats from the lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their
 chances of winning within the rules as stated, assuming that the other
 chefs behave in the same manner. In the event that a chef has more than
 one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is
 always the one with the next-closest turn.
Define Wn(k) as the probability that chef #k wins in a competition with
 n chefs. If we have S(1) = 0.25, S(2) = 0.5, and S(3) = 1, then W3(1)
 = 0.29375.
Going forward, we assign S(k) = Fk/Fn+1 over all 1 ≤ k ≤ n, where
 Fk is a Fibonacci number: Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 with base cases F1 = F2 =
 1. Then, for example, when considering a competition with n = 7 chefs,
 we have W7(1) = 0.08965042, W7(2) = 0.20775702, W7(3) = 0.15291406,
 W7(4) = 0.14554098, W7(5) = 0.15905291, W7(6) = 0.10261412, and W7(7)
 = 0.14247050, rounded to 8 decimal places each.
Let E(n) represent the expected number of dishes cooked in a competition
 with n chefs. For instance, E(7) = 42.28176050.
Find E(14) rounded to 8 decimal places.

Problem 483

We define a permutation as an operation that rearranges the order of
 the elements {1, 2, 3, ..., n}.
There are n! such permutations, one of which leaves the elements in
 their initial order.
For n = 3 we have 3! = 6 permutations:
- P1 = keep the initial order
- P2 = exchange the 1st and 2nd elements
- P3 = exchange the 1st and 3rd elements
- P4 = exchange the 2nd and 3rd elements
- P5 = rotate the elements to the right
- P6 = rotate the elements to the left


If we select one of these permutations, and we re-apply the same
 permutation repeatedly, we eventually restore the initial order.For a
 permutation Pi, let f(Pi) be the number of steps required to restore
 the initial order by applying the permutation Pi repeatedly.For n =
 3, we obtain:- f(P1) = 1 : (1,2,3) → (1,2,3)- f(P2) = 2 : (1,2,3)
 → (2,1,3) → (1,2,3)- f(P3) = 2 : (1,2,3) → (3,2,1) → (1,2,3)-
 f(P4) = 2 : (1,2,3) → (1,3,2) → (1,2,3)- f(P5) = 3 : (1,2,3) →
 (3,1,2) → (2,3,1) → (1,2,3)- f(P6) = 3 : (1,2,3) → (2,3,1) →
 (3,1,2) → (1,2,3)


Let g(n) be the average value of f2(Pi) over all permutations

The triple (a,b,c) indicates the size of three heaps.
Under this extra rule, (2,4,5) is one of the losing positions for the
 next player.
To illustrate:
- Alice moves to (2,4,3)
- Bob   moves to (0,4,3)
- Alice moves to (0,2,3)
- Bob   moves to (0,2,1)
Unlike ordinary three-heap Nim, (0,1,2) and its permutations are the
 end states of this game.
For an integer N, we define F(N) as the sum of a+b+c for all the losing
 positions for the next player, with 0 < a < b < c < N.
For example, F(8) = 42, because there are 4 losing positions for the
 next player, (1,3,5), (1,4,6), (2,3,6) and (2,4,5).
We can also verify that F(128) = 496062.

Let G(a, b) be the smallest non-negative integer n for which gcd(n3 + b,
 (n + a)3 + b) is maximized.

There are n stones in a pond, numbered 1 to n. Consecutive stones are
 spaced one unit apart.
A frog sits on stone 1. He wishes to visit each stone exactly once,
 stopping on stone n. However, he can only jump from one stone to another
 if they are at most 3 units apart. In other words, from stone i, he
 can reach a stone j if 1 ≤ j ≤ n and j is in the set {i-3, i-2,
 i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3}.
Let f(n) be the number of ways he can do this. For example, f(6) = 14,

1 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 5 → 6
1 → 4 → 5 → 2 → 3 → 6
Other examples are f(10) = 254 and f(40) = 1439682432976.

Problem 494

The Collatz sequence is defined as:
$a_{i+1} = \left\{  \large{\frac {a_i} 2 \atop 3 a_i+1} {\text{if
 }a_i\text{ is even} \atop \text{if }a_i\text{ is odd}} \right.$.


The Collatz conjecture states that starting from any positive integer,
 the sequence eventually reaches the cycle 1,4,2,1....
We shall define the sequence prefix p(n) for the Collatz sequence starting
 with a1 = n as the sub-sequence of all numbers not a power of 2 (20=1
 is considered a power of 2 for this problem). For example:p(13) = {13,
 40, 20, 10, 5} p(8) = {}
Any number invalidating the conjecture would have an infinite length
 sequence prefix.


Let Sm be the set of all sequence prefixes of length m. Two sequences {a1,
 a2, ..., am} and {b1, b2, ..., bm} in Sm are said to belong to the same
 prefix family if ai < aj if and only if bi < bj for all 1 ≤ i,j ≤ m.


For example, in S4, {6, 3, 10, 5} is in the same family as {454, 227,
 682, 341}, but not {113, 340, 170, 85}.

 of k distinct positive integers.
For example, W(144,4) = 7. There are 7 ways in which 144 can be written
 as a product of 4 distinct positive integers:
144 = 1×2×4×18
144 = 1×2×8×9
144 = 1×2×3×24
144 = 1×2×6×12
144 = 1×3×4×12
144 = 1×3×6×8
144 = 2×3×4×6
Note that permutations of the integers themselves are not considered
 distinct.
Furthermore, W(100!,10) modulo 1 000 000 007 = 287549200.
Find W(10000!,30) modulo 1 000 000 007.

Problem 496
Given an integer sided triangle ABC:
Let I be the incenter of ABC.
Let D be the intersection between the line AI and the circumcircle of ABC
 (A ≠ D).
We define F(L) as the sum of BC for the triangles ABC that satisfy AC =
 DI and BC ≤ L.
For example, F(15) = 45 because the triangles ABC with (BC,AC,AB) =
 (6,4,5), (12,8,10), (12,9,7), (15,9,16) satisfy the conditions.
Find F(109).

Problem 497
Bob is very familiar with the famous mathematical puzzle/game, "Tower
 of Hanoi," which consists of three upright rods and disks of different
 sizes that can slide onto any of the rods. The game begins with a stack
 of n disks placed on the leftmost rod in descending order by size. The
 objective of the game is to move all of the disks from the leftmost
 rod to the rightmost rod, given the following restrictions:
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A valid move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing
 it onto another stack (or an empty rod).
No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.
Moving on to a variant of this game, consider a long room k units (square
 tiles) wide, labeled from 1 to k in ascending order. Three rods are
 placed at squares a, b, and c, and a stack of n disks is placed on the
 rod at square a.
Bob begins the game standing at square b. His objective is to play the
 Tower of Hanoi game by moving all of the disks to the rod at square
 c. However, Bob can only pick up or set down a disk if he is on the
 same square as the rod / stack in question.
Unfortunately, Bob is also drunk. On a given move, Bob will either stumble
 one square to the left or one square to the right with equal probability,
 unless Bob is at either end of the room, in which case he can only move
 in one direction. Despite Bob's inebriated state, he is still capable
 of following the rules of the game itself, as well as choosing when to
 pick up or put down a disk.
The following animation depicts a side-view of a sample game for n = 3,
 k = 7, a = 2, b = 4, and c = 6:

Let E(n,k,a,b,c) be the expected number of squares that Bob travels
 during a single optimally-played game. A game is played optimally if
 the number of disk-pickups is minimized.
Interestingly enough, the result is always an integer. For example,
 E(2,5,1,3,5) = 60 and E(3,20,4,9,17) = 2358.
Find the last nine digits of ∑1≤n≤10000 E(n,10n,3n,6n,9n).

Problem 498
For positive integers n and m, we define two polynomials Fn(x) = xn and
 Gm(x) = (x-1)m.
We also define a polynomial Rn,m(x) as the remainder of the division of
 Fn(x) by Gm(x).
For example, R6,3(x) = 15x2 - 24x + 10.
Let C(n, m, d) be the absolute value of the coefficient of the d-th
 degree term of Rn,m(x).
We can verify that C(6, 3, 1) = 24 and C(100, 10, 4) = 227197811615775.

Problem 499
A gambler decides to participate in a special lottery. In this lottery
 the gambler plays a series of one or more games.
Each game costs m pounds to play and starts with an initial pot of 1
 pound. The gambler flips an unbiased coin. Every time a head appears,
 the pot is doubled and the gambler continues. When a tail appears, the
 game ends and the gambler collects the current value of the pot. The
 gambler is certain to win at least 1 pound, the starting value of the
 pot, at the cost of m pounds, the initial fee.
The game ends if the gambler's fortune falls below m pounds.
Let pm(s) denote the probability that the gambler will never run out of
 money in this lottery given an initial fortune s and the cost per game m.
For example p2(2) ≈ 0.2522, p2(5) ≈ 0.6873 and
 p6(10 000) ≈ 0.9952 (note: pm(s) = 0 for s < m).

Problem 502
We define a block to be a rectangle with a height of 1 and an
 integer-valued length. Let a castle be a configuration of stacked blocks.
Given a game grid that is w units wide and h units tall, a castle is
 generated according to the following rules:
Blocks can be placed on top of other blocks as long as nothing sticks
 out past the edges or hangs out over open space.
All blocks are aligned/snapped to the grid.
Any two neighboring blocks on the same row have at least one unit of
 space between them.
The bottom row is occupied by a block of length w.
The maximum achieved height of the entire castle is exactly h.
The castle is made from an even number of blocks.
The following is a sample castle for w=8 and h=5:

Let F(w,h) represent the number of valid castles, given grid parameters
 w and h.
For example, F(4,2) = 10, F(13,10) = 3729050610636, F(10,13) =
 37959702514, and F(100,100) mod 1 000 000 007 = 841913936.

Problem 503
Alice is playing a game with n cards numbered 1 to n.
A game consists of iterations of the following steps.
(1) Alice picks one of the cards at random.
(2) Alice cannot see the number on it. Instead, Bob, one of her friends,
 sees the number and tells Alice how many previously-seen numbers are
 bigger than the number which he is seeing.
(3) Alice can end or continue the game. If she decides to end, the number
 becomes her score. If she decides to continue, the card is removed from
 the game and she returns to (1). If there is no card left, she is forced
 to end the game.
Let F(n) be the Alice's expected score if she takes the optimized strategy
 to minimize her score.
For example, F(3) = 5/3. At the first iteration, she should continue the
 game. At the second iteration, she should end the game if Bob says that
 one previously-seen number is bigger than the number which he is seeing,
 otherwise she should continue the game.
We can also verify that F(4) = 15/8 and F(10) ≈ 2.5579365079.
Find F(106). Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places behind the
 decimal point.

Consider the Gaussian integer i-1. A base i-1 representation of a Gaussian
 integer a+bi is a finite sequence of digits dn-1dn-2...d1d0 such that:

Each dk is in {0,1}
There are no leading zeroes, i.e. dn-1 ≠ 0, unless a+bi is itself 0
Here are base i-1 representations of a few Gaussian integers:

Problem 509

Anton and Bertrand love to play three pile Nim.
However, after a lot of games of Nim they got bored and changed the
 rules somewhat.
They may only take a number of stones from a pile that is a proper
 divisor of the number of stones present in the pile. E.g. if a pile at
 a certain moment contains 24 stones they may take only 1,2,3,4,6,8 or
 12 stones from that pile.
So if a pile contains one stone they can't take the last stone from it
 as 1 isn't a proper divisor of 1.
The first player that can't make a valid move loses the game.
Of course both Anton and Bertrand play optimally.

The triple (a,b,c) indicates the number of stones in the three piles.

Problem 514
A geoboard (of order N) is a square board with equally-spaced pins
 protruding from the surface, representing an integer point lattice for
 coordinates 0 ≤ x,y ≤ N.
John begins with a pinless geoboard. Each position on the board is a
 hole that can be filled with a pin. John decides to generate a random
 integer between 1 and N+1 (inclusive) for each hole in the geoboard. If
 the random integer is equal to 1 for a given hole, then a pin is placed
 in that hole.
After John is finished generating numbers for all (N+1)2 holes and
 placing any/all corresponding pins, he wraps a tight rubberband around
 the entire group of pins protruding from the board. Let S represent
 the shape that is formed. S can also be defined as the smallest convex
 shape that contains all the pins.

 indicate positions where pins have been placed, and the blue lines
 collectively represent the rubberband. For this particular arrangement,
 S has an area of 6. If there are fewer than three pins on the board
 (or if all pins are collinear), S can be assumed to have zero area.

 a block without gaps and every coin in a higher row touching exactly
 two coins in the row below is called a fountain of coins. Let f(n)

 present, occurs an odd number of times, and any even digit, if present,

Problem 522
Despite the popularity of Hilbert's infinite hotel, Hilbert decided to
 try managing extremely large finite hotels, instead.
To cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special
 generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the
 top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert
 could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having
 the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.
Unfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they
 built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to
 another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom
 to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on
 certain floors.
For example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:

If the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would
 receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors
 instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that
 while a given floor can receive power from many other floors at once,
 it can only send power to one other floor.
To resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal
 number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it
 sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts
 can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first
 floor instead of the third floor.
Let F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over
 all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of n floors. For example,
 F(3) = 6, F(8) = 16276736, and F(100) mod 135707531 = 84326147.
Find F(12344321) mod 135707531.

 lexicographical order, and assign to each permutation an index In(P)
 from 1 to n! corresponding to its position in the list.

Let Q(n, k) = min(In(P)) for F(P) = k, the index of the first permutation
 requiring exactly k steps to sort with First Sort. If there is no

Problem 525
An ellipse E(a, b) is given at its initial position by equation:
$\frac {x^2} {a^2} + \frac {(y - b)^2} {b^2} = 1$
The ellipse rolls without slipping along the x axis for one complete
 turn. Interestingly, the length of the curve generated by a focus is
 independent from the size of the minor axis:
$F(a,b) =  2 \pi \text{ } max(a,b)$

Problem 527
A secret integer t is selected at random within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ n.
The goal is to guess the value of t by making repeated guesses, via
 integer g. After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes,
 in which it will be revealed that either g < t, g = t, or g > t. Then
 the process can repeat as necessary.
Normally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with
 a binary search: Given a lower bound L and upper bound H (initialized to
 L = 1 and H = n), let g = ⌊(L+H)/2⌋ where ⌊⋅⌋ is the integer
 floor function. If g = t, the process ends. Otherwise, if g < t, set L =
 g+1, but if g > t instead, set H = g−1. After setting the new bounds,
 the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once t is found. Even
 if t can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be
 required anyway to confirm the value.
Your friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much
 better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting g = ⌊(L+H)/2⌋,
 simply let g be a random integer between L and H, inclusive. The rest
 of the algorithm is the same as the standard binary search. This new
 search routine will be referred to as a random binary search.
Given that 1 ≤ t ≤ n for random t, let B(n) be the expected number of
 guesses needed to find t using the standard binary search, and let R(n)
 be the expected number of guesses needed to find t using the random
 binary search. For example, B(6) = 2.33333333 and R(6) = 2.71666667
 when rounded to 8 decimal places.
Find R(1010) − B(1010) rounded to 8 decimal places.

Problem 532
Bob is a manufacturer of nanobots and wants to impress his customers by
 giving them a ball coloured by his new nanobots as a present.
His nanobots can be programmed to select and locate exactly one other
 bot precisely and, after activation, move towards this bot along the
 shortest possible path and draw a coloured line onto the surface while
 moving. Placed on a plane, the bots will start to move towards their
 selected bots in a straight line. In contrast, being placed on a ball,
 they will start to move along a geodesic as the shortest possible
 path. However, in both cases, whenever their target moves they will
 adjust their direction instantaneously to the new shortest possible
 path. All bots will move at the same speed after their simultaneous
 activation until each bot reaches its goal.
Now Bob places n bots on the ball (with radius 1) equidistantly on a
 small circle with radius 0.999 and programs each of them to move toward
 the next nanobot sitting counterclockwise on that small circle. After
 activation, the bots move in a sort of spiral until they finally meet
 at one point on the ball.
Using three bots, Bob finds that every bot will draw a line of length
 2.84, resulting in a total length of 8.52 for all three bots, each time
 rounded to two decimal places. The coloured ball looks like this:

In order to show off a little with his presents, Bob decides to use just
 enough bots to make sure that the line each bot draws is longer than
 1000. What is the total length of all lines drawn with this number of
 bots, rounded to two decimal places?

Problem 534
The classical eight queens puzzle is the well known problem of placing
 eight chess queens on a 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten
 each other. Allowing configurations to reappear in rotated or mirrored
 form, a total of 92 distinct configurations can be found for eight
 queens. The general case asks for the number of distinct ways of placing
 n queens on a n×n board, e.g. you can find 2 distinct configurations
 for n=4.
Let's define a weak queen on a n×n board to be a piece which can
 move any number of squares if moved horizontally, but a maximum of
 n−1−w squares if moved vertically or diagonally, 0≤w<n being the
 "weakness factor". For example, a weak queen on a n×n board with a
 weakness factor of w=1 located in the bottom row will not be able to
 threaten any square in the top row as the weak queen would need to move
 n−1 squares vertically or diagonally to get there, but may only move
 n−2 squares in these directions. In contrast, the weak queen is not
 handicapped horizontally, thus threatening every square in its own row,
 independently from its current position in that row.
Let Q(n,w) be the number of ways n weak queens with weakness factor w can
 be placed on a n×n board so that no two queens threaten each other. It
 can be shown, for example, that Q(4,0)=2, Q(4,2)=16 and Q(4,3)=256.
Let $S(n)=\displaystyle\sum_{w=0}^{n-1} Q(n,w)$.
You are given that S(4)=276 and S(5)=3347.

The circled numbers are consecutive integers starting with 1.
Immediately preceding each non-circled numbers ai, there are exactly
 ⌊√ai⌋ adjacent circled numbers, where ⌊⌋ is the floor function.
If we remove all circled numbers, the remaining numbers form a sequence
 identical to S, so S is a fractal sequence.Let T(n) be the sum of the
 first n elements of the sequence.
You are given T(1) = 1, T(20) = 86, T(103) = 364089 and

 side lengths are 4 elements (si, sj, sk, sl) of S (all i, j, k, l
 distinct). If there are many quadrilaterals with the same maximum area,
 then choose the one with the largest perimeter.

 lengths 14 and 27 and both leg lengths 9. The area of this quadrilateral
 is 127.611470879... It can be shown that this is the largest area for any

Let un = 2B(3n) + 3B(2n) + B(n+1), where B(k) is the number of 1

For example, B(6) = 2, B(10) = 2 and B(15) = 4, and
 u5 = 24 + 32 + 2 = 27.
Also, let Un be the sequence (u1, u2, ..., un).

$1^k + 2^k + ... + n^k = \sum_{i=1}^n i^k = \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} a_{i} n^i =
 a_{1} n + a_{2} n^2 + ... + a_{k} n^k + a_{k+1} n^{k + 1}$,
where ai's are rational coefficients that can be written as reduced
 fractions pi/qi (if ai = 0, we shall consider qi = 1).
For example, $1^4 + 2^4 + ... + n^4 = -\frac 1 {30} n + \frac 1 3 n^3 +
 \frac 1 2 n^4 + \frac 1 5 n^5.$
Define D(k) as the value of q1 for the sum of kth powers (i.e. the
 denominator of the reduced fraction a1).
Define F(m) as the mth value of k ≥ 1 for which D(k) = 20010.
You are given D(4) = 30 (since a1 = -1/30), D(308) = 20010,
 F(1) = 308, F(10) = 96404.

Problem 546
Define fk(n) = $\sum_{i=0}^{n}$ fk($\lfloor\frac{i}{k}\rfloor$) where
 fk(0) = 1 and $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the floor function.
For example, f5(10) = 18, f7(100) = 1003, and f2(103) = 264830889564.
Find $(\sum_{k=2}^{10}$ fk(1014)$)$ mod (109+7).

Problem 547
Assuming that two points are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution)
 within a rectangle, it is possible to determine the expected value of
 the distance between these two points.
For example, the expected distance between two random points in a unit
 square is about 0.521405, while the expected distance between two random
 points in a rectangle with side lengths 2 and 3 is about 1.317067.
Now we define a hollow square lamina of size n to be an integer sized
 square with side length n ≥ 3 consisting of n2 unit squares from
 which a rectangle consisting of x × y unit squares (1 ≤ x,y ≤ n -
 2) within the original square has been removed.
For n = 3 there exists only one hollow square lamina:

For n = 4 you can find 9 distinct hollow square laminae, allowing shapes
 to reappear in rotated or mirrored form:

Let S(n) be the sum of the expected distance between two points chosen
 randomly within each of the possible hollow square laminae of size
 n. The two points have to lie within the area left after removing the
 inner rectangle, i.e. the gray-colored areas in the illustrations above.
For example, S(3) = 1.6514 and S(4) = 19.6564, rounded to four digits
 after the decimal point.
Find S(40) rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

Problem 548

 and {1,6,12}.
Let g(n) be the number of gozinta chains for n, so g(12)=8.
g(48)=48 and g(120)=132.

Let S(n) be ∑s(i) for 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
S(100)=2012.

Problem 550

Two players are playing a game, alternating turns. There are k piles
 of stones.
On each turn, a player has to choose a pile and replace it with two
 piles of stones under the following two conditions:

 Both new piles must have a number of stones more than one and less than
the number of stones of the original pile.
 The number of stones of each of the new piles must be a divisor of the
number of stones of the original pile.  The first player unable to make
a valid move loses.

Let f(n,k) be the number of winning positions for the first player,
   assuming perfect play, when the game is played with k piles each
   having between 2 and n stones (inclusively).f(10,5)=40085.

Problem 551
Let a0, a1, a2, ... be an integer sequence defined by:
a0 = 1;
for n ≥ 1, an is the sum of the digits of all preceding terms.
The sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 23, 28, 38, 49, ...
You are given a106 = 31054319.
Find a1015.

Problem 552

Let An be the smallest positive integer satisfying  An mod pi = i  for
   all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where pi is the
i-th prime.
For example A2 = 5, since this is the smallest positive solution of the
 system of equations A2 mod 2 = 1 A2 mod 3 = 2
The system of equations for A3 adds another constraint. That is, A3 is
 the smallest positive solution of A3 mod 2 = 1 A3 mod 3 = 2 A3 mod 5 = 3
and hence A3 = 23. Similarly, one gets A4 = 53 and A5 = 1523.


Let S(n) be the sum of all primes up to n that divide at least one
 element in the sequence A.
For example, S(50) = 69 = 5 + 23 + 41, since 5 divides A2, 23 divides A3
 and 41 divides A10 = 5765999453. No other prime number up to 50 divides
 an element in A.

Problem 553
Let P(n) be the set of the first n positive integers {1, 2, ..., n}.
Let Q(n) be the set of all the non-empty subsets of P(n).
Let R(n) be the set of all the non-empty subsets of Q(n).
An element X ∈ R(n) is a non-empty subset of Q(n), so it is itself
 a set.
From X we can construct a graph as follows:
Each element Y ∈ X corresponds to a vertex and labeled with Y;
Two vertices Y1 and Y2 are connected if Y1 ∩ Y2 ≠ ∅.
For example, X = {{1}, {1,2,3}, {3}, {5,6}, {6,7}} results in the
 following graph:

This graph has two connected components.
Let C(n,k) be the number of elements of R(n) that have exactly k connected
 components in their graph.

Problem 554
On a chess board, a centaur moves like a king or a knight. The diagram
 below shows the valid moves of a centaur (represented by an inverted
 king) on an 8x8 board.

It can be shown that at most n2 non-attacking centaurs can be placed on
 a board of size 2n×2n.
Let C(n) be the number of ways to place n2 centaurs on a 2n×2n board
 so that no centaur attacks another directly.
For example C(1) = 4, C(2) = 25, C(10) = 1477721.

Problem 555

The McCarthy 91 function is defined as follows:
$$
M_{91}(n) = \begin{cases}
        n - 10 & \text{if } n > 100 \\
        M_{91}(M_{91}(n+11)) & \text{if } 0 \leq n \leq 100 \end{cases}
$$


We can generalize this definition by abstracting away the constants into
    new variables:

$$
M_{m,k,s}(n) = \begin{cases}
        n - s & \text{if } n > m \\
        M_{m,k,s}(M_{m,k,s}(n+k)) & \text{if } 0 \leq n \leq m \end{cases}
$$


This way, we have $M_{91} = M_{100,11,10}$.


Let $F_{m,k,s}$ be the set of fixed points of $M_{m,k,s}$. That is,

$$F_{m,k,s}= \left\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \, | \, M_{m,k,s}(n) = n \right\}$$


For example, the only fixed point of $M_{91}$ is $n = 91$. In other words,
    $F_{100,11,10}= \{91\}$.


Now, define $SF(m,k,s)$ as the sum of the elements in $F_{m,k,s}$ and
    let $S(p,m) = \displaystyle \sum_{1 \leq s < k \leq p}{SF(m,k,s)}$.


For example, $S(10, 10) = 225$ and $S(1000, 1000)=208724467$.


Find $S(10^6, 10^6)$.


Problem 556
A Gaussian integer is a number z = a + bi where a, b are integers
    and i2 = -1.
Gaussian integers are a subset of the complex numbers, and the integers
    are the subset of Gaussian integers for which b = 0.
A Gaussian integer unit is one for which a2 + b2 = 1, i.e. one of 1,
    i, -1, -i.
Let's define a proper Gaussian integer as one for which a > 0 and
    b ≥ 0.
A Gaussian integer z1 = a1 + b1i is said to be divisible by
    z2 = a2 + b2i if z3 = a3 + b3i = z1/z2 is a Gaussian
    integer.
$\frac {z_1} {z_2} = \frac {a_1 + b_1 i} {a_2 + b_2 i} = \frac {(a_1 +
    b_1 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} {(a_2 + b_2 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} = \frac {a_1 a_2
    + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2} + \frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 +
    b_2^2}i = a_3 + b_3 i$
So, z1 is divisible by z2 if $\frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$
    and $\frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ are integers.
For example, 2 is divisible by 1 + i because 2/(1 + i) = 1 - i
    is a Gaussian integer.
A Gaussian prime is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a unit,
    itself or itself times a unit.
For example, 1 + 2i is a Gaussian prime, because it is only
    divisible by 1, i, -1, -i, 1 + 2i, i(1 + 2i) = i - 2,
    -(1 + 2i) = -1 - 2i and -i(1 + 2i) = 2 - i.
2 is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by 1 + i.
A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit
    and proper Gaussian primes.
For example 2 = -i(1 + i)2 and 1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i).
A Gaussian integer is said to be squarefree if its prime factorization
    does not contain repeated proper Gaussian primes.
So 2 is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but 1 + 3i is.
Units and Gaussian primes are squarefree by definition.
Let f(n) be the count of proper squarefree Gaussian integers with
    a2 + b2 ≤ n.
For example f(10) = 7 because 1, 1 + i, 1 + 2i,
    1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i), 2 + i, 3 and
    3 + i = -i(1 + i)(1 + 2i) are squarefree, while
    2 = -i(1 + i)2 and 2 + 2i = -i(1 + i)3 are not.
You are given f(102) = 54, f(104) = 5218 and f(108) = 52126906.
Find f(1014).

Problem 557

A triangle is cut into four pieces by two straight lines, each starting
    at one vertex and ending on the opposite edge. This results in
    forming three smaller triangular pieces, and one quadrilateral.
    If the original triangle has an integral area, it is often possible to
    choose cuts such that all of the four pieces also have integral area.
    For example, the diagram below shows a triangle of area 55 that has
    been cut in this way.



Representing the areas as a, b, c and d, in the example above, the
    individual areas are a = 22, b = 8, c = 11 and d = 14.  It is also
    possible to cut a triangle of area 55 such that a = 20, b = 2, c =
    24, d = 9.

Define a triangle cutting quadruple (a, b, c, d) as a valid integral
    division of a triangle, where a is the area of the triangle between
    the two cut vertices, d is the area of the quadrilateral and b and
    c are the areas of the two other triangles, with the restriction
    that b ≤ c.  The two solutions described above are (22,8,11,14)
    and (20,2,24,9).  These are the only two possible quadruples that
    have a total area of 55.


Define S(n) as the sum of the area of the uncut triangles represented
    by all valid quadruples with a+b+c+d ≤ n. For example, S(20) = 259.


Find S(10000).


Problem 558
Let r be the real root of the equation x3 = x2 + 1.
Every positive integer can be written as the sum of distinct increasing
    powers of r.
If we require the number of terms to be finite and the difference between
    any two exponents to be three or more, then the representation
    is unique.
For example, 3 = r -10 + r -5 + r -1 + r 2 and
    10 = r -10 + r -7 + r 6.
Interestingly, the relation holds for the complex roots of the equation.
Let w(n) be the number of terms in this unique representation of n. Thus
    w(3) = 4 and w(10) = 3.
More formally, for all positive integers n, we have:n = $\displaystyle
    \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}$ bk rk
under the conditions that:bk is 0 or 1 for all
    k;bk + bk+1 + bk+2 ≤ 1 for all k;w(n) = $\displaystyle
    \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}$ bk is finite.
Let S(m) = $\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{m}$ w(j2).
You are given S(10) = 61 and S(1000) = 19403.
Find S(5 000 000).

Problem 559
An ascent of a column j in a matrix occurs if the value of column j is
    smaller than the value of column j+1 in all rows.

Let P(k, r, n) be the number of r x n matrices with the following
    properties:
The rows are permutations of {1, 2, 3, ... , n}.  Numbering the first
 column as 1, a column ascent occurs at column j<n if and only if j is
 not a multiple of k.
For example, P(1, 2, 3) = 19, P(2, 4, 6) = 65508751 and  P(7, 5, 30)
 mod 1000000123 = 161858102.

Let Q(n) =$\,  \displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n\,$ P(k, n, n).
For example, Q(5) = 21879393751 and Q(50) mod 1000000123 = 819573537.

Find Q(50000) mod 1000000123.

Problem 560
Coprime Nim is just like ordinary normal play Nim, but the players may
 only remove a number of stones from a pile  that is coprime with the
 current size of the pile. Two players remove stones in turn. The player
 who removes the last stone wins.
Let L(n, k) be the number of losing starting positions for the first
 player, assuming perfect play, when the game is played with k piles,
 each having between 1 and n - 1 stones inclusively.
For example, L(5, 2) = 6 since the losing initial positions are
 (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2) and (4, 4).
You are also given L(10, 5) = 9964, L(10, 10) = 472400303,
 L(103, 103) mod 1 000 000 007 = 954021836.

Problem 561

Let $S(n)$ be the number of pairs $(a,b)$ of distinct divisors of $n$
 such that $a$ divides $b$.
For $n=6$ we get the following pairs: $(1,2), (1,3), (1,6),( 2,6)$
 and $(3,6)$. So $S(6)=5$.
Let $p_m\#$ be the product of the first $m$ prime numbers,  so $p_2\#
 = 2*3 = 6$.
Let $E(m, n)$ be the highest integer $k$ such that $2^k$ divides
 $S((p_m\#)^n)$.
$E(2,1) = 0$ since $2^0$ is the highest power of 2 that divides S(6)=5.
Let $Q(n)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} E(904961, i)$
$Q(8)=2714886$.


Evaluate $Q(10^{12})$.

Construct triangle ABC such that:
Vertices A, B and C are lattice points inside or on the circle of radius
 r centered at the origin;
the triangle contains no other lattice point inside or on its edges;
the perimeter is maximum.Let R be the circumradius of triangle ABC and
 T(r) = R/r.
For r = 5, one possible triangle has vertices (-4,-3), (4,2)  and (1,0)
 with perimeter $\sqrt{13}+\sqrt{34}+\sqrt{89}$ and circumradius R =
 $\sqrt {\frac {19669} 2 }$, so T(5) =$\sqrt {\frac {19669} {50} }$.
You are given T(10) ~ 97.26729 and T(100) ~ 9157.64707.
Find T(107). Give your answer rounded to the nearest integer.

Problem 563
A company specialises in producing large rectangular metal sheets,
 starting from unit square metal plates.  The welding is performed by
 a range of robots of increasing size.  Unfortunately, the programming
 options of these robots are rather limited.  Each one can only process
 up to 25 identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along either
 edge to produce a larger rectangle.  The only programmable variables
 are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including 25),
 and whether to weld the long or short edge.
For example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together 11 raw
 unit square plates to make a 11×1 strip.  The next could take 10 of
 these 11×1 strips, and weld them either to make a longer 110×1 strip,
 or a 11×10 rectangle.  Many, but not all, possible dimensions of  metal
 sheets can be constructed in this way.
One regular customer has a particularly unusual order: The finished
 product should have an exact area, and the long side must not be more
 than 10% larger than the short side. If these requirements can be met
 in more than one way, in terms of the exact dimensions of the two sides,
 then the customer will demand that all variants be produced. For example,
 if the order calls for a metal sheet of area 889200, then there are three
 final dimensions that can be produced: 900×988, 912×975 and 936×950.
 The target area of 889200 is the smallest area which can be manufactured
 in three different variants, within the limitations of the robot welders.
Let M(n) be the minimal area that can be manufactured in exactly n
 variants with the longer edge not greater than 10% bigger than the
 shorter edge.  Hence M(3) = 889200.
Find $ \sum_{n=2}^{100} M(n)$.

Problem 564
A line segment of length $2n-3$ is randomly split into $n$ segments of
 integer length ($n \ge 3$). In the sequence given by this split, the
 segments are then used as consecutive sides of a convex $n$-polygon,
 formed in such a way that its area is maximal.  All of the $\binom{2n-4}
 {n-1}$ possibilities for splitting up the initial line segment occur
 with the same probability.
Let $E(n)$ be the expected value of the area that is obtained by this
 procedure.
For example, for $n=3$ the only possible split of the line segment of
 length $3$ results in three line segments with length $1$, that form
 an equilateral triangle with an area of $\frac 1 4 \sqrt{3}$. Therefore
 $E(3)=0.433013$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.
For $n=4$ you can find $4$ different possible splits, each of which is
 composed of three line segments with length $1$ and one line segment with
 length $2$. All of these splits lead to the same maximal quadrilateral
 with an area of $\frac 3 4 \sqrt{3}$, thus $E(4)=1.299038$, rounded to
 $6$ decimal places.
Let $S(k)=\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}^k E(n)$.
For example, $S(3)=0.433013$, $S(4)=1.732051$, $S(5)=4.604767$ and
 $S(10)=66.955511$, rounded to $6$ decimal places each.
Find $S(50)$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.

Problem 565
Let $\sigma(n)$ be the sum of the divisors of $n$.
E.g. the divisors of 4 are 1, 2 and 4, so $\sigma(4)=7$.


The numbers $n$ not exceeding 20 such that 7 divides  $\sigma(n)$ are:
 4,12,13 and 20, the sum of these numbers being 49.


Let $S(n , d)$ be the sum of the numbers $i$ not exceeding $n$ such that
 $d$ divides $\sigma(i)$.
So $S(20 , 7)=49$.



You are given: $S(10^6,2017)=150850429$ and $S(10^9 ,
 2017)=249652238344557$.


Find $S(10^{11} , 2017)$


Problem 566
Adam plays the following game with his birthday cake.
He cuts a piece forming a circular sector of 60 degrees and flips the
 piece upside down, with the icing on the bottom.
He then rotates the cake by 60 degrees counterclockwise, cuts an adjacent
 60 degree piece and flips it upside down.
He keeps repeating this, until after a total of twelve steps, all the
 icing is back on top.
Amazingly, this works for any piece size, even if the cutting angle is
 an irrational number: all the icing will be back on top after a finite
 number of steps.
Now, Adam tries something different: he alternates cutting pieces of size
 $x=\frac{360}{9}$ degrees, $y=\frac{360}{10}$ degrees and $z=\frac{360
 }{\sqrt{11}}$ degrees. The first piece he cuts has size x and he flips
 it. The second has size y and he flips it. The third has size z and
 he flips it. He repeats this with pieces of size x, y and z in that
 order until all the icing is back on top, and discovers he needs 60
 flips altogether.

Let F(a, b, c) be the minimum number of piece flips needed to get all
 the icing back on top for pieces of size $x=\frac{360}{a}$ degrees,
 $y=\frac{360}{b}$ degrees and $z=\frac{360}{\sqrt{c}}$ degrees.
Let $G(n) = \sum_{9 \le a < b < c \le n} F(a,b,c)$, for integers a,
 b and c.
You are given that F(9, 10, 11) = 60, F(10, 14, 16) = 506,
 F(15, 16, 17) = 785232.
You are also given G(11) = 60, G(14) = 58020 and G(17) = 1269260.
Find G(53).

Problem 567
Tom has built a random generator that is connected to a row of $n$
 light bulbs. Whenever the random generator is activated each of the $n$
 lights is turned on with the probability of $\frac 1 2$, independently
 of its former state or the state of the other light bulbs.
While discussing with his friend Jerry how to use his generator, they
 invent two different games, they call the reciprocal games:
Both games consist of $n$ turns. Each turn is started by choosing a
 number $k$ randomly between (and including) $1$ and $n$, with equal
 probability of $\frac 1 n$ for each number, while the possible win for
 that turn is the reciprocal of $k$, that is $\frac 1 k$.
In game A, Tom activates his random generator once in each turn. If
 the number of lights turned on is the same as the previously chosen
 number $k$, Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive
 nothing for that turn. Jerry's expected win after playing the total
 game A consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_A(n)$. For example
 $J_A(6)=0.39505208$, rounded to 8 decimal places.
For each turn in game B, after $k$ has been randomly selected, Tom keeps
 reactivating his random generator until exactly $k$ lights are turned
 on. After that Jerry takes over and reactivates the random generator
 until he, too, has generated a pattern with exactly $k$ lights turned
 on. If this pattern is identical to Tom's last pattern, Jerry wins and
 gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive nothing. Jerry's expected win
 after the total game B consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_B(n)$. For
 example $J_B(6)=0.43333333$, rounded to 8 decimal places.
Let $\displaystyle S(m)=\sum_{n=1}^m (J_A(n)+J_B(n))$. For example
 $S(6)=7.58932292$, rounded to 8 decimal places.
Find S(123456789), rounded to 8 decimal places.

Problem 568
Tom has built a random generator that is connected to a row of $n$
 light bulbs. Whenever the random generator is activated each of the $n$
 lights is turned on with the probability of $\frac 1 2$, independently
 of its former state or the state of the other light bulbs.
While discussing with his friend Jerry how to use his generator, they
 invent two different games, they call the reciprocal games:
Both games consist of $n$ turns. Each turn is started by choosing a
 number $k$ randomly between (and including) $1$ and $n$, with equal
 probability of $\frac 1 n$ for each number, while the possible win for
 that turn is the reciprocal of $k$, that is $\frac 1 k$.
In game A, Tom activates his random generator once in each turn. If
 the number of lights turned on is the same as the previously chosen
 number $k$, Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive
 nothing for that turn. Jerry's expected win after playing the total
 game A consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_A(n)$. For example
 $J_A(6)=0.39505208$, rounded to 8 decimal places.
For each turn in game B, after $k$ has been randomly selected, Tom keeps
 reactivating his random generator until exactly $k$ lights are turned
 on. After that Jerry takes over and reactivates the random generator
 until he, too, has generated a pattern with exactly $k$ lights turned
 on. If this pattern is identical to Tom's last pattern, Jerry wins and
 gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive nothing. Jerry's expected win
 after the total game B consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_B(n)$. For
 example $J_B(6)=0.43333333$, rounded to 8 decimal places.
Let $D(n)=J_B(n)−J_A(n)$. For example, $D(6) = 0.03828125$.
Find the 7 most significant digits of $D(123456789)$ after removing all
 leading zeros.
(If, for example, we had asked for the 7 most significant digits of
 $D(6)$, the answer would have been 3828125.)

Problem 569
A mountain range consists of a line of mountains with slopes of exactly
 45°, and heights governed by the prime numbers, pn. The up-slope of
 the kth mountain is of height p2k−1, and the downslope is p2k. The
 first few foot-hills of this range are illustrated below.


Tenzing sets out to climb each one in turn, starting from the lowest. At
 the top of each peak, he looks back and counts how many of the previous
 peaks he can see. In the example above, the eye-line from the third
 mountain is drawn in red, showing that he can only see the peak of the
 second mountain from this viewpoint. Similarly, from the 9th mountain,
 he can see three peaks, those of the 5th, 7th and 8th mountain.
Let P(k) be the number of peaks that are visible looking back from the
 kth mountain.  Hence P(3)=1 and P(9)=3.
Also $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{100} P(k) = 227$.
Find $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{2500000} P(k)$.

Problem 570
A snowflake of order n is formed by overlaying an equilateral triangle
 (rotated by 180 degrees) onto each equilateral triangle of the same
 size in a snowflake of order n-1. A snowflake of order 1 is a single
 equilateral triangle.

Some areas of the snowflake are overlaid repeatedly. In the above picture,
 blue represents the areas that are one layer thick, red two layers thick,
 yellow three layers thick, and so on.
For an order n snowflake, let A(n) be the number of triangles that are
 one layer thick, and let B(n) be the number of triangles that are three
 layers thick. Define G(n) = gcd(A(n), B(n)).
E.g. A(3) = 30, B(3) = 6, G(3)=6
A(11) = 3027630, B(11) = 19862070, G(11) = 30
Further, G(500) = 186 and  $\sum_{n=3}^{500}G(n)=5124$
Find $\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}^{10^7}G(n)$.

Problem 571
A positive number is pandigital in base b if it contains all digits from
 0 to b - 1 at least once when written in base b.
A n-super-pandigital number is a number that is simultaneously pandigital
 in all bases from 2 to n inclusively.
For example 978 = 11110100102 = 11000203 = 331024 = 124035 is
 the smallest 5-super-pandigital number.
Similarly, 1093265784 is the smallest 10-super-pandigital number.
The sum of the 10 smallest 10-super-pandigital numbers is 20319792309.
What is the sum of the 10 smallest 12-super-pandigital numbers?

Problem 572

A matrix $M$ is called idempotent if $M^2 = M$.
Let $M$ be a three by three matrix :
$M=\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c\\ d & e & f\\ g &h &i\\
\end{pmatrix}$.
Let C(n) be the number of  idempotent three by three matrices $M$ with
  integer elements such that
$ -n \le a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i \le n$.

C(1)=164 and C(2)=848.


Find C(200).


Problem 573
$n$ runners in very different training states want to compete in a
  race. Each one of them is given a different starting number $k$
  $(1\leq k \leq n)$ according to the runner's (constant) individual
  racing speed being $v_k=\frac{k}{n}$.
In order to give the slower runners a chance to win the race, $n$
  different starting positions are chosen randomly (with uniform
  distribution) and independently from each other within the racing track
  of length $1$. After this, the starting position nearest to the goal is
  assigned to runner $1$, the next nearest starting position to runner $2$
  and so on, until finally the starting position furthest away from the
  goal is assigned to runner $n$. The winner of the race is the runner
  who reaches the goal first.
Interestingly, the expected running time for the winner is $\frac{1}{2}$,
  independently of the number of runners. Moreover, while it can be
  shown that all runners will have the same expected running time of
  $\frac{n}{n+1}$, the race is still unfair, since the winning chances
  may differ significantly for different starting numbers:
Let $P_{n,k}$ be the probability for runner $k$ to win a race with $n$
  runners and $E_n = \sum_{k=1}^n k P_{n,k}$ be the expected starting
  number of the winner in that race. It can be shown that, for example,
$P_{3,1}=\frac{4}{9}$, $P_{3,2}=\frac{2}{9}$, $P_{3,3}=\frac{1}{3}$
  and $E_3=\frac{17}{9}$ for a race with $3$ runners.
You are given that $E_4=2.21875$, $E_5=2.5104$ and $E_{10}=3.66021568$.
Find $E_{1000000}$ rounded to 4 digits after the decimal point.

Problem 574
Let $q$ be a prime and $A \ge B >0$ be two integers with the following
 properties: $A$ and $B$ have no prime factor in common, that is
 $\text{gcd}(A,B)=1$.  The product $AB$ is divisible by every prime less
 than q.
It can be shown that, given these conditions, any sum $A+B<q^2$ and any
 difference $1<A-B<q^2$ has to be a prime number. Thus you can verify that
 a number $p$ is prime by showing that either $p=A+B<q^2$ or $p=A-B<q^2$
 for some $A,B,q$ fulfilling the conditions listed above.
Let $V(p)$ be the smallest possible value of $A$ in any sum $p=A+B$
 and any difference $p=A-B$, that verifies $p$ being prime. Examples:
$V(2)=1$, since $2=1+1< 2^2$.
$V(37)=22$, since $37=22+15=2 \cdot 11+3 \cdot 5< 7^2$ is the associated
 sum with the smallest possible $A$.
$V(151)=165$ since $151=165-14=3 \cdot 5 \cdot 11 - 2 \cdot 7<13^2$
 is the associated difference with the smallest possible $A$.

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of $V(p)$ for all primes $p<n$. For example,
 $S(10)=10$ and $S(200)=7177$.

Find $S(3800)$.


Problem 575
It was quite an ordinary day when a mysterious alien vessel appeared as if
 from nowhere. After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is
 decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon
 entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure,
 Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.
She claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission
 was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational
 power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the
 universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard,
 along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful
 computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through
 a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that
 the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So,
 for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the
 rooms would be numbered in the following way.


Many millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer
 and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy
 of such knowledge.
Katharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given
 instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the
 same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to
 them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between
 remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii)
 an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the
 other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.

(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits
(ii) Fixed 50% probability of remaining

The records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean
 that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number
 of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed
 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there
 is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information
 we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of
 the choices being implemented.
Katharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the
 probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid
 after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476
 [12 d.p.].
In order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must
 calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in
 the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.
(Give your answer rounded to 12 decimal places)

Problem 576

A bouncing point moves counterclockwise along a circle with circumference
 $1$ with  jumps of constant length $l<1$, until it hits a gap of
 length $g<1$, that is placed in a distance $d$ counterclockwise from
 the starting point. The gap does not include the starting point, that
 is $g+d<1$.
Let $S(l,g,d)$ be the sum of the length of all jumps, until the point
 falls into the gap. It can be shown that $S(l,g,d)$ is finite for any
 irrational jump size $l$, regardless of the values of $g$ and $d$.
Examples:
$S(\sqrt{\frac 1 2}, 0.06, 0.7)=0.7071 \dots$, $S(\sqrt{\frac 1 2}, 0.06,
 0.3543)=1.4142 \dots$ and  $S(\sqrt{\frac 1 2}, 0.06, 0.2427)=16.2634
 \dots$.

Let $M(n, g)$ be the maximum of $ \sum S(\sqrt{\frac 1 p}, g, d)$ for
 all primes $p \le n$ and any valid value of $d$.
Examples:
$M(3, 0.06) =29.5425 \dots$, since $S(\sqrt{\frac 1 2}, 0.06,
 0.2427)+S(\sqrt{\frac 1 3}, 0.06, 0.2427)=29.5425 \dots$ is the maximal
 reachable sum for $g=0.06$.
$M(10, 0.01)=266.9010 \dots$
Find $M(100, 0.00002)$, rounded to 4 decimal places.

Problem 577
An equilateral triangle with integer side length $n \ge 3$ is divided
 into $n^2$ equilateral triangles with side length 1 as shown in the
 diagram below.
The vertices of these triangles constitute a triangular lattice with
 $\frac{(n+1)(n+2)} 2$ lattice points.
Let $H(n)$ be the number of all regular hexagons that can be found by
 connecting 6 of these points.



For example, $H(3)=1$, $H(6)=12$ and $H(20)=966$.
Find $\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}^{12345} H(n)$.

Problem 578
Any positive integer can be written as a product of prime powers:
 p1a1 × p2a2 × ... × pkak,
where pi are distinct prime integers, ai > 0 and pi < pj if i < j.
A decreasing prime power positive integer is one for which ai ≥ aj
 if i < j.
For example, 1, 2, 15=3×5, 360=23×32×5 and 1000=23×53 are decreasing
 prime power integers.
Let C(n) be the count of decreasing prime power positive integers not
 exceeding n.
C(100) = 94 since all positive integers not exceeding 100 have
 decreasing prime powers except 18, 50, 54, 75, 90 and 98.
You are given C(106) = 922052.
Find C(1013).

Problem 579
A lattice cube is a cube in which all vertices have integer
 coordinates. Let C(n) be the number of different lattice cubes in
 which the coordinates of all vertices range between (and including)
 0 and n. Two cubes are hereby considered different if any of their
 vertices have different coordinates.
For example, C(1)=1, C(2)=9, C(4)=100, C(5)=229, C(10)=4469 and
 C(50)=8154671.

Different cubes may contain different numbers of lattice points.

For example, the cube with the vertices
(0, 0, 0), (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3), (0, 3, 3), (3, 0, 3), (3,
 3, 0), (3, 3, 3) contains 64 lattice points (56 lattice points on the
 surface including the 8 vertices and 8 points within the cube).
In contrast, the cube with the vertices
(0, 2, 2), (1, 4, 4), (2, 0, 3), (2, 3, 0), (3, 2, 5), (3, 5, 2), (4, 1,
 1), (5, 3, 3) contains only 40 lattice points (20 points on the surface
 and 20 points within the cube), although both cubes have the same side
 length 3.


Let S(n) be the sum of the lattice points contained in the different
 lattice cubes in which the coordinates of all vertices range between
 (and including) 0 and n.
For example, S(1)=8, S(2)=91, S(4)=1878, S(5)=5832, S(10)=387003 and
 S(50)=29948928129.
Find S(5000) mod 109.

Problem 580

A Hilbert number is any positive integer of the form $4k+1$ for integer
 $k\geq 0$.  We shall define a squarefree Hilbert number as a Hilbert
 number which is not divisible by the square of any Hilbert number
 other than one.  For example, $117$ is a squarefree Hilbert number,
 equaling $9\times13$.  However $6237$ is a Hilbert number that is not
 squarefree in this sense, as it is divisible by $9^2$.  The number $3969$
 is also not squarefree, as it is divisible by both $9^2$ and $21^2$.


There are $2327192$ squarefree Hilbert numbers below $10^7$.
How many squarefree Hilbert numbers are there below $10^{16}$?


Problem 581

A number is p-smooth if it has no prime factors larger than p.
Let T be the sequence of triangular numbers, ie T(n)=n(n+1)/2.
Find the sum of all indices n such that T(n) is 47-smooth.


Problem 582

Let a, b and c be the sides of an integer sided triangle with one angle
 of 120 degrees, a≤b≤c and b-a≤100.
Let T(n) be the number of such triangles with c≤n.
T(1000)=235 and T(108)=1245.
Find T(10100).


Problem 583

A standard envelope shape is a convex figure consisting of an isosceles
 triangle (the flap) placed on top of a rectangle.  An example of an
 envelope with integral sides is shown below.  Note that to form a
 sensible envelope, the perpendicular height of the flap (BCD) must be
 smaller than the height of the rectangle (ABDE).




In the envelope illustrated, not only are all the sides integral, but
 also all the diagonals (AC, AD, BD, BE and CE) are integral too. Let
 us call an envelope with these properties a Heron envelope.


Let S(p) be the sum of the perimeters of all the Heron envelopes with
 a perimeter less than or equal to p.


You are given that S(104) = 884680.  Find S(107).


Problem 584
A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the Wimwians, inhabitants
 of planet WimWi, discovered an unmanned drone that had landed on their
 planet. On examining the drone, they uncovered a device that sought
 the answer for the so called "Birthday Problem". The description of
 the problem was as follows:
If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one,
 what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first
 find 3 people with Birthdays within 1 day from each other.
The description further instructed them to enter the answer into the
 device and send the drone into space again. Startled by this turn of
 events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year
 on Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely
 birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days),
 and found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians
 entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.
After traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet
 Joka. The same events ensued except this time, the numbers in the device
 had changed due to some unknown technical issues. The description read:
If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one,
 what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first
 find 3 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other.
With a 100-day year on the planet, the Jokars (inhabitants of Joka)
 found the answer to be 8.48967364 (rounded to 8 decimal places because
 the device allowed only 8 places after the decimal point) assuming
 equally likely birthdays. They too entered the answer into the device
 and launched the drone into space again.
This time the drone landed on planet Earth. As before the numbers in
 the problem description had changed. It read:
If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one,
 what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first
 find 4 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other.
What would be the answer (rounded to eight places after the decimal point)
 the people of Earth have to enter into the device for a year with 365
 days? Ignore leap years. Also assume that all birthdays are equally
 likely and independent of each other.

Problem 585
Consider the term $\small \sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}$ that is representing
 a nested square root. $x$, $y$ and $z$ are positive integers and $y$
 and $z$ are not allowed to be perfect squares, so the number below the
 outer square root is irrational. Still it can be shown that for some
 combinations of $x$, $y$ and $z$ the given term can be simplified into
 a sum and/or difference of simple square roots of integers, actually
 denesting the square roots in the initial expression.
Here are some examples of this denesting:
$\small \sqrt{3+\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{1}=\sqrt{2}+1$
$\small \sqrt{8+\sqrt{15}+\sqrt{15}}=\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{3}$
$\small
 \sqrt{20+\sqrt{96}+\sqrt{12}}=\sqrt{9}+\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}=3+\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}$
$\small
 \sqrt{28+\sqrt{160}+\sqrt{108}}=\sqrt{15}+\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{5}-\sqrt{2}$
As you can see the integers used in the denested expression may also be
 perfect squares resulting in further simplification.
Let F($n$) be the number of different terms $\small
 \sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}$, that can be denested into the sum and/or
 difference of a finite number of square roots, given the additional
 condition that $0<x \le n$. That is,
$\small \displaystyle \sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}=\sum_{i=1}^k
 s_i\sqrt{a_i}$
with $k$, $x$, $y$, $z$ and all $a_i$ being positive integers, all $s_i
 =\pm 1$ and $x\le n$. Furthermore $y$ and $z$  are not allowed to be
 perfect squares.
Nested roots with the same value are not considered different,
 for example $\small \sqrt{7+\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{27}}$, $\small
 \sqrt{7+\sqrt{12}+\sqrt{12}}$ and $\small \sqrt{7+\sqrt{27}+\sqrt{3}}$,
 that can all three be denested into $\small 2+\sqrt{3}$, would only be
 counted once.
You are given that F(10)=17, F(15)=46, F(20)=86, F(30)=213 and F(100)=2918
 and F(5000)=11134074.
Find F(5000000).

Problem 586

The number 209 can be expressed as $a^2 + 3ab + b^2$ in two distinct ways:


$ \qquad 209 = 8^2 + 3\cdot 8\cdot 5 + 5^2$
$ \qquad 209 = 13^2 + 3\cdot13\cdot 1 + 1^2$


Let $f(n,r)$ be the number of integers $k$ not exceeding $n$ that can be
 expressed as $k=a^2 + 3ab + b^2$, with $a\gt b>0$ integers, in exactly
 $r$ different ways.


You are given that $f(10^5, 4) = 237$ and $f(10^8, 6) = 59517$.


Find $f(10^{15}, 40)$.


Problem 587

A square is drawn around a circle as shown in the diagram below on
 the left.
We shall call the blue shaded region the L-section.
A line is drawn from the bottom left of the square to the top right as
 shown in the diagram on the right.
We shall call the orange shaded region a concave triangle.




It should be clear that the concave triangle occupies exactly half of
 the L-section.



Two circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is
 drawn around both circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to
 the top right as shown in the diagram below.




This time the concave triangle occupies approximately 36.46% of the
 L-section.


If n circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is
 drawn around the n circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to
 the top right, then it can be shown that the least value of n for which
 the concave triangle occupies less than 10% of the L-section is n = 15.


What is the least value of n for which the concave triangle occupies
 less than 0.1% of the L-section?
