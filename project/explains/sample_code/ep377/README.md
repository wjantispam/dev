# [for loops are just while loops in disguise (beginner - intermediate)](https://youtu.be/Pq2aXxTKFv4)

A break from python today -- we show C-like for loops and how they are actually just while loops in disguise!  I also show how to translate some while loops into for loops!

## Interactive examples

### Bash

```bash
g++ t.cpp
./a.out
```
