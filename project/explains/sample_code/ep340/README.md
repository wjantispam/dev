# [the most important skill I've learned for software engineering (beginner)](https://youtu.be/ritp4gAqNMI)

Today we talk about the most important skill I've learned for software engineering -- I also give you an easy framework to approach this yourself!

## Interactive examples

### Notes

1. let them *why*
    - useful to avoid XY problem
    - give the other person enough context to help you

2. tell them what you did
    - tell them the versions of the things you're using
    - tell them what command you ran
    - etc.

3. tell them what you expect to see
    - outputs, side-effects, etc.

4. tell them what happened
    - outputs, crash reports, etc.
    - copy the textual outputs if possible instead of posting screenshots

5. (optional) minimize your reproduction
    - useful to eliminate a lot of noise
    - narrow to exactly your problem

6. (debugging) dive into the code!
