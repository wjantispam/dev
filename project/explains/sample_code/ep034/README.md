# [what is test driven development? (beginner - intermediate)](https://youtu.be/JmMxU8ljiOg)

Today I give a small demo of test driven development using pytest and talk a little bit about when I like to use it to work on things!

## Setup commands

```bash
virtualenv venv

. venv/bin/activate

pip install pytest
```

## Interactive examples

### Bash

```bash
python -m pydoc colorsys
pytest t.py
```
