# [setting up an ubuntu focal virtual machine (beginner - intermediate)](https://youtu.be/qL3xc8hwU7c)

Today I set up an ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine similar to how I set up the VMs I do my development in on stream and for videos! Quick video talking about a little shell feature that I wish I had know about earlier :)

## Interactive examples

### Bash

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install gcc perl make --no-install-recommends
```
