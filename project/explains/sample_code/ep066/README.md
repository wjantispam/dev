# [protip: exiting really fast! (beginner)](https://youtu.be/yLdxwugv4qM)

Today I talk about one of the things I wish I knew sooner in my programming career and I'm passing it along to you!

## Interactive examples

### Python

```python
exit()
```

### Sqlite

```console
.quit
```

### Node

```console
process.exit()
```

### Bash

```bash
bash
exit
unset PYTHONSTARTUP
python
sqlite3
node
sh
# Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl-d
```
