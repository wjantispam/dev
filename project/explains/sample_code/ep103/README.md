# [why python -m pip? (beginner - intermediate)](https://youtu.be/gnYdk_U6UQ0)

Today I talk about how it's easy to get confused when installing packages and how to fix that with a different command! (as well as fun times on windows)

## Interactive examples

### Python

```python
import httpx
```

### Bash

```bash
python3 -m pip install httpx
python3

python2
python2 -m pip install astpretty

head -1 $(which pip)
```

### Windows CMD

```batch
pip install pip --upgrade
python -m pip install pip --upgrade
python -m pip install pip==9.0.3
```
