Hours = list[tuple[int, int]]

combine_business_hours(hours: Hours) -> Hours


Yelp displays business hours on the webpage!

The data is sourced from several locations, some
comes from user submitted data and other data is
purchased and imported from third party provides.

This data is of varying quality so Yelp needs to
massage this data to make sure it is presentable
to users.

This interview question is about one stage of
sanitizing the data: combining adjacent ranges!

Our data will be represented as a list of 2-tuples
representing the "open" and "close" time.

Here is example:

    [(1, 2), (2, 3), (5, 6)] => [(1, 3), (5, 6)]
